He studied Fine Art and photography at Newport College of Art in South Wales and then, as a postgraduate, Fine Art Printmaking at Winchester School of Art in Hampshire. He has previously exhibited his photographs and photomontages in a solo exhibition at Oriel Colwyn in 2012/2013. Titled ‘Shifting Sands’, these pictures presented his family holidays in Rhyl from the 1960s to the 1980s.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Stephen lived in San Diego, Southern California. During his stay in the city, he photographed the landscape extensively. This archive of negatives has been the starting point for a number of exhibitions and publications. In 2020, his photographs of California were exhibited in a solo show titled ‘Alien Resident’ and a smaller selection were exhibited online as ‘Drive Thru’, a Virtual Reality gallery created by Aaron Tonks.\n\nStephen has published his photographs of Rhyl and San Diego as photobooks with Café Royal Books. He has also worked with other independent photobook publishers including Out of Place Books, who published ‘NYC-19XX’ in 2020; these photographs of New York are the inspiration for the exhibition ‘Stars, Stripes and Steam’ currently exhibiting at Oriel Colwyn. Stephen is currently working on two new publications: photographs of New York with Café Royal Books and photographs of Midwest USA taken in the late 1990s with Fistful of Books.\n\nStephen Clarke is Senior Lecturer in Art and Design: Critical and Contextual Studies at the University of Chester, UK.

She worked for 15 years as a humanist Buddhist psychotherapist before beginning her creative practice.\n\nAfter visiting the Louise Bourgeois retrospective at the Tate London (2007), Davey was immediately inspired to translate her history creatively. In 2011, at the age of 48, she found her medium. The camera relinquished Davey’s psychotherapy work and committed her to the process of creativity.\n\nHer photography work is an investigation of the psychological landscapes of both herself and those around her. Davey’s four children and her community are central to her practice. She draws upon her childhood years as a constant narrative to inform her practice.\n\nBeginning in 2020, she transformed her abandoned garden into a vibrant space, filled with wildflowers, birdsong and people.  Over three summers and in collaboration with her son Luke, Davey cultivated a botanical space rooted in love, joy and togetherness. When the flowers bloomed, they called in the community and photographed them. The resulting portraits became an expression of yearning, defiance, joy and interconnectedness. \n\nIn 2012, Davey completed an MA in Photography at Plymouth University and went on to complete an MFA the following year.\n\nDavey has been the recipient for awards including the winner of the Arnold Newman Award for New Directions in Portraiture, Prix Virginia Woman’s Photography Award and 3 consecutive years the National Gallery Taylor Wessing Portrait Award. Her book ‘Looking for Alice’ was shortlisted for Paris Photo – Aperture Best Book Award Shortlist 2016 and shortlisted for the Kraszna – Krausz Foundation Book Award and recently short listed for the Prix Pictet the Prix Elysée and in 2023 awarded the Royal Photographic Society Honorary Fellow\n\nDavey is represented by the Michael Hoppen Gallery London and her work is held by major collections including The Science Museum, London; The Victoria & Albert Museum, London; The French National Collection, Paris; the Martin Parr Foundation; Bristol and the National Portrait Gallery.\n\n{{IMAGE 7}}\nGarden Gate © Sian Davey\n\n{{IMAGE 8}}\nWilderness © Sian Davey\n\n{{IMAGE 9}}\nFestival © Sian Davey\n\nTUESDAY 8th OCTOBER\n\nSIMON ROBERTS\n\nTICKETS – SOLD OUT\n\n{{IMAGE 10}}\n\nSimon Roberts (b.1974) is a visual artist based in Brighton, UK. Widely recognised for his large-format, tableaux photographs of the British landscape, his practice also encompasses video, text and installation work, which together, interrogate notions of identity and belonging, and the complex relationship between history, place and culture.\n\nIn 2010 he was commissioned as the official British Election Artist by the House of Commons Works of Art Committee to produce a record of the General Election on behalf of the UK Parliamentary Art Collection; and in 2014 he represented Britain during the UK-Russia Year of Culture.\n\nHe has exhibited widely, and his photographs reside in major public and private collections, including the George Eastman House, Deutsche Börse Art Collection and Victoria & Albert Museum. In 2010 he was commissioned as the official British Election Artist by the House of Commons Works of Art Committee.\n\nHe is the author of several monographs including Motherland (2007), We English (2009), Pierdom (2013) and Merrie Albion – Landscape Studies of a Small Island (2017).\n\n{{IMAGE 11}}\nLondon Olympiad © Simon Roberts\n\n{{IMAGE 12}}\nMerrie Albion © Simon Roberts\n\n{{IMAGE 13}}\nPierdom © Simon Roberts\n\nSATURDAY 28th SEPTEMBER\n\nDENNIS MORRIS\n\nTICKETS – SOLD OUT\n\n{{IMAGE 14}}\n\nDennis Morris started his career at an early age. He was 11 years old when one of his photographs was printed on the front page of the Daily Mirror. A camera fanatic since the age of 8, Dennis was known around his East End neighbourhood as Mad Dennis, due to his preference for photography over football. After inadvertently stumbling across a particularly feisty demonstration by the PLO one Sunday, the sharp young Dennis took his film to a photo agency on Fleet Street who promptly sold it to the Daily Mirror for £16. Accustomed to raising money for films and camera parts by taking photos of christenings and birthday parties, Dennis was suddenly on to something; his hobby and all-consuming passion could be done for a living. It was whilst bunking off school to wait for Bob Marley to arrive for soundcheck at the Speak Easy Club on Margaret Street, that Dennis’s music photography career really began. Marley, quite taken with the young teenager who was waiting for him, invited Dennis to come along and take pictures on the remainder of the tour. Running home to Dalston, Dennis packed his bag and jumped on the bus. His photographs of Marley and The Wailers became famous the world over, appearing on the cover of Time Out and Melody Maker before Dennis had even turned 17. \n\nIt was Dennis’s photos of Marley that caught the eye of the young Johnny Rotten. Rotten, a massive reggae fan, had long admired Dennis’s work and requested that he take the first official shots of the Sex Pistols upon signing to Virgin Records. Still in his teens, Dennis was the same age as the Pistols and they soon learned to trust him completely, allowing him unrestricted access to their strange and chaotic existence. For a year, Dennis trailed the band, taking hundreds of undisputed classic shots of the band. The only photographer to put the Sex Pistols fully at ease in front of the lens, Dennis’s work with the band established, not only their public image, but also Dennis’s position as one of the most exciting and striking music photographers in the country. When the Pistols split it was Dennis who accompanied John Lydon and Richard Branson on holiday to Jamaica. Now a close friend of Lydon’s, the pair set about finding young reggae artists for Branson’s record label. Enthused by the A&R bug, Dennis took a job as Art Director at Island Records and signed The Slits and L.K.J to the label. Still working with John Lydon, Dennis was instrumental in creating the seminal P.i.L sleeves, logo and metal box. His passion for music led him to form his own pioneering black punk band, Basement Five. The next few years were filled with music, as Dennis broke from the mould of one-trick music smudge and involved himself with making records. In 1984 he formed drum & bass outfit Urban Shakedown, who were picked up by Paul Weller to be the first release on his Respond label. His late 80s hip-hop outfit, Boss, were later signed to Virgin Records and released 4 singles.\n\nWith a career spanning more than 20 years, and a c.v. that reads like a Who’s Who of popular music and culture, Dennis Morris continues to photograph the leading musicians of the time such as Bush, Oasis and The Prodigy. Several books of his work have been published such as Bob Marley: A Rebel Life; he has held exhibitions in the UK, Japan and Canada, and his photographs have appeared in Rolling Stone, Time, People magazine, and the Sunday Times, amongst others. \n\nDennis Morris now lives in London with his wife and children. A professional photographer of high-regard, he is also involved with projects for the BBC and Channel 4.\n\n{{IMAGE 15}}\n© Dennis Morris\n\n{{IMAGE 16}}\n© Dennis Morris\n\n{{IMAGE 17}}\n© Dennis Morris\n\nTHURSDAY 12th SEPTEMBER\n\nROO LEWIS\n\nTICKETS – SOLD OUT\n\n{{IMAGE 18}}\n\nRoo Lewis is photographer based in North London. His previous projects have ranged from documenting Druids in the West Country, Hollywood Jesus in LA and Elvis Tribute artists in Wales. He has worked with publications such as Vogue, The Guardian, and VICE amongst others, and been commissioned by brands including Toast, Island Records, Belstaff, Sony and Martell.\n\nHis work has appeared at the National Portrait Gallery and the Royal Academy.\n\nRoo’s long-term projects are developed by building trust with communities, conveying his subjects with empathy, emotion and integrity which is further emphasised by employing an analogue approach.\n\nOver a period of two years Roo photographed the Welsh town of Port Talbot which, according to actor Michael Sheen, has an ‘extremely high number of UFO sightings’. However, the resulting book Port Talbot UFO Investigation Club(published by GOST in 2023) is not a study of UFO sightings but instead uses the phenomena as a starting point to explore the people, landscape and folklore of the town…\n\n{{IMAGE 19}}\n\n{{IMAGE 20}}\n© Roo Lewis\n\n{{IMAGE 21}}\n© Roo Lewis\n\nWEDNESDAY 28th AUGUST\n\nCOLIN WILKINSON\n\nTICKETS – SOLD OUT!\n\n{{IMAGE 22}}\nProfile Image – Outside Burberry, Regent St – London, 2023 ©John Perivolaris\n\nAfter a short career lecturing in further education, Colin Wilkinson left in 1973 to create a pioneering media project in Liverpool. Based on the Canadian Challenge for Change programme, Merseyside Visual Communications Unit gave community groups access to training and resources in film, video and photography. \n\nIn 1977, Open Eye Gallery emerged as the public face of the organisation, exhibiting masters of photography such as Lewis Hine, August Sander, Edward Weston and Imogen Cunningham alongside emerging talents including Tom Wood, Brian Griffiths and Bruce Gilden. \n\nIn 1982, Colin left to create photographic company Light Impressions and started publishing books, postcards and posters.

His principal commissions in Britain during the 1970’s – 1980’s, were for what used to be called the “weekend colour supplements” such as The Telegraph, The Sunday Times, The Observer, You and the Sunday Express magazines. \n\nHe covered weekly news for Newsweek, Time, and the former Now! Magazine; covering conflicts in Israel, Lebanon, and Northern Ireland, as well as weekly news in the UK. Over the last fifty years he has shot numerous magazine portraits of the famous and not so famous – at home, at work and at play.

In 2016 Dewi Lewis Publishing re-published this volume with over 50 ‘new’ images from his archive.  \n\nHomer is the author, and co-author-photographer of nine books about Britain as well as Shanghai Odyssey (Dewi Lewis Publishing) and On the Road Again (Mansion Editions). The latter, an American project, was started in 1969, while he was at college.

He is the author of several photobooks, A Pink Flamingo (2015), Sugar Paper Theories (2016), Parliament of Owls (2019), Latent Bloom (2020) & Beggar’s Honey (2023). \n\nHis work has featured in a number of solo shows which include, Reykjavik Museum of Photography, TJ Boulting Gallery and the Royal Photographic Society. Parliament of Owls was exhibited at Oriel Colwyn in 2020\n\nIn ‘Parliament of Owls’, Jack Latham explores the effects that a vacuum of information can cause.\n\nNestled within the redwood forests of Monte Rio, northern California, sits Bohemian Grove, a 2,700-acre retreat owned by the exclusive gentlemen’s San Francisco Bohemian Club, founded in 1872.Every summer, the retreat is frequented by the political and business elite of the US. Shrouded in secrecy, the activities at the grove have become the subject of countless conspiracy theories and rumours.\n\nJack’s latest work, ‘Beggar’s Honey’ is an exploration into the clandestine world of click farms. Click farms are shadowy operations that are responsible for artificially inflating the engagement metrics of content on social media, manipulating the algorithms with serious consequences – from influencing consumer behaviour to compromising the integrity of democratic processes.\n\nJack Latham’s project seeks to expose the inner workings of click farms for the very first time. By juxtaposing the captivating with the covert, he challenges our perception of the digital landscape and urges us to question the authenticity of the content we encounter daily.\n\nLatham’s projects have also gone on to win multiple awards including the Bar-Tur Photobook award (2015), Image Vevey – Heidi.News Prize (2019) and BJP International Photography Award (2019).\n\n{{IMAGE 30}}\nPhantom Patriot was the name taken by Richard McCaslin of Carson City, Nevada, who, on January 19, 2002, attempted an attack on the Bohemian Grove after viewing Alex Jones’ documentary.

Tutored by Ansel Adams and Nancy and Beaumont Newhall, she photographed the Black Power movement in the late 1960s and Berkeley People’s Park protest and riots of 1969. Arriving in England in 1970, she embarked on a continuous series of long-term projects including five years documenting Irish travellers. Her later work includes the Greenham Common Women’s Camp, the multicultural community squat in St Agnes Place, London, and the BAME and Rastafarian communities in Brixton. Her latest work includes six months photographing in the Calais ‘Jungle’ and Grande-Synthe refugee camp in Dunkirk. Always politically committed, Janine’s outstanding work is in the best traditions of humanist photography.\n\nIn 1977, Janine Wiedel set out in her VW campervan to photograph industry in England’s West Midlands – once the heart of the Industrial Revolution. A region that was home to thousands of businesses – from potteries and jewellers to coal mines, steel and iron works – was in steep decline; underinvestment over many decades in both premises and machinery had created a depressing situation where once world-leading businesses were no longer competitive internationally and facing a grim future.\n\nJanine realised that this was a critical turning point in Britain’s industrial history and she set out to document the workers within their working environment. She was given remarkable access by the factories and was welcomed by the workforce, who greatly appreciated her interest in recording not just their daily work routines but also the bonding and social interaction that was so important in often grim factory environments. This industrial work became Vulcan’s Forge, which was exhibited in The Photographers Gallery in 1979 and is now a beautiful 250+ page monograph recently published by {{LINK 5}}Bluecoat Press.\n\n{{IMAGE 36}}\nThe Workshop at Smiths Drop Forge in Aston, Birmingham West Midland UK 1978 ©Janine Wiedel\n\n{{IMAGE 37}}\nBlack Panther Rally to Free Huey Newton at Federal Building in San Francisco California in May 1969 ©Janine Wiedel\n\nWEDNESDAY 5th JUNE\n\nMICHELLE SANK\n\nTICKETS – SOLD OUT\n\n{{IMAGE 38}}\n\nMichelle Sank was born in South Africa and settled in the UK in 1987. She grew up during Apartheid and is the daughter of Latvian immigrants. She cites this background as informing her interest in sub-cultures and the exploration of contemporary social issues and challenges. Her crafted portraits meld place and person creating sociological, visual and psychological landscapes and narratives.\n\nHer photographs have been exhibited and published extensively in the UK, Europe, Australia and Mexico, South Africa and the U.S.A. Her imagery is held in the permanent collections of Allan Servais, Brussels, Open Eye Gallery Archive, Liverpool, Societe Jersiaise and Guernsey Museum, Channel Islands, Southeast Museum of Photography, Florida and The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, Texas, RAMM, Exeter and The Museum of Youth Culture, UK.\n\nShe has won numerous prestigious awards, including:\n\nThe Taylor Wessing Portrait Prize, British Journal of Photography, and more recently, the Portraiture Category in the The Sony World Photography Awards 2024.\n\nShe has 5 Published Books to date, her latest work about the {{LINK 6}}Burnthouse Lane Community in Exeter having just this month been published by {{LINK 7}}Dewi Lewis.\n\n{{IMAGE 39}}\n Zenande, Sinawe, Zinathi, and Buhle (winning image in the Sony World Photo Award for Portraiture 2024) ©Michelle Sank\n\n{{IMAGE 40}}\nMaurice from My.Self ©Michelle Sank\n\nWEDNESDAY 22nd MAY\n\nDANIEL MEADOWS & MARK McNULTY\n\nTICKETS – SOLD OUT\n\n{{IMAGE 41}}\n\nDaniel Meadows, photographer and digital storyteller, is a twentieth century pioneer of British documentary practice. His photographs and audio recordings, made for over fifty years, capture uniquely the felt life of the everyday in England. Challenging the status quo he has always worked collaboratively, in a sensitive and gently respectful way.\n\nFiercely independent from the outset, Meadows contrived his own ways of working: running a free portrait studio in Moss Side (1972), then travelling 10,000 miles in his converted double-decker the Free Photographic Omnibus (1973-74) to make a national portrait, a project he returned to a quarter-of-a-century later. As an early adopter of digital tools he was among the first to combine audio with photographs to make digital stories. Repeatedly he has returned to those he has photographed, listening for how things are and how they’ve changed.\n\nDaniel recently spoke at our Northern Eye Photography Festival on the 50th Aniversary of his Free Photographic Omnibus project.\n\nInspired by this, we commissioned North Wales based photographer Mark McNulty to work with us to create our new exhibition – A Bay View (now on display at the Coed Pella building). During October half-term we set up a free pop-up studio in the Bayview Shopping Centre and photographed passers-by over a period of four days.\n\nMark McNulty‘s career as a professional photographer has been wide and varied for over thirty years. For much of his early career he specialised in working in the music industry, touring with bands and shooting gigs and club culture across the uk.\n\nSince those early days he has expanded to cover a diverse and varied range of subjects including lifestyle, portraiture and arts.\n\nMark recently exhibited 35 Summers at Oriel Colwyn celebrating approximately thirty five years of music photography by Mark and was the first full retrospective of his vast music photography archive.\n\nWe photographed 307 people with Mark for our Bay View exhibition and this snapshot is our own archive of people and life in Colwyn Bay in 2023. We hope that in another 50 years’ time it can be looked back on with the same affection as Daniel’s photographs now are, remembering family, faces, friendships, styles and fashions… and that the people we photographed can also then take their own place in history.\n\nWe are pleased that Mark will be joining us in discussion with Daniel for the last part of the evening’s talk.\n\n{{IMAGE 42}}\n‘Bootboys’: left-to-right, Brian Morgan, Martin Tebay, Paul McMillan, Phil Tickle, Mike Comish, Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria.

However, he is best known for travelling across the country producing colourful and celebratory street portraits from the North of Scotland, all the way south to Cornwall.\n\nHis work has been exhibited at a variety of galleries and museums across the country and internationally including the Martin Parr Foundation, the Museum of London and of course, Oriel Colwyn and its outdoor projects across towns in North Wales. In coming months exhibitions of his work will be held in Spain and Belgium.\n\nIn recent years his work has moved in new directions including a long series entitled Nightfall which focusses on the early evening transition between day and night. Even though Niall grew up on a small farm in rural Perthshire, this series of images shot across the UK reﬂects his intense love for city spaces. At the same time the work has an underlying sense of melancholy often associated with dusk.\n\nNiall will talk about his ongoing projects, his continued joy in making daily street photographs and the restless urge to continue journeying across the UK.\n\n{{IMAGE 51}}\nWalworth, South London – Feb’ 2022 ©Niall McDiarmid\n\n{{IMAGE 52}}\nBermondsey, London – Jan’ 2022 ©Niall McDiarmid\n\nTHURSDAY 28th MARCH\n\nMOHAMED HASSAN\n\nTICKETS – SOLD OUT!\n\n{{IMAGE 53}}\n\nMOHAMED HASSAN, originally from Alexandria in Egypt, has been living and working in Pembrokeshire, in west Wales in the UK since 2007.\n\nLiving and studying in Wales has been pivotal to his journey as an artist as he becomes more connected to the people, communities and land of Wales. As a result of these experiences he is devoted to continue his journey as a Welsh artist, graduating with a 1st class honours degree in Photography from Carmarthen School of Art in 2016.\n\nAs an artist with dual nationality, Mohamed’s projects explore his identity as part of an ever expanding diasporic community based in Wales.\n\n{{IMAGE 54}}\n\nThe constant feeling of displacement and questions of identity are forever present.\n\nWhen Mohamed first arrived here he felt as if he was in a dream, and as he discovered and explored more of Wales found inspiration in the rugged landscapes around him. As a newcomer to Wales he has also become captivated with its rich and artistic culture and language, steeped in ancient folklore and song – and has a continuing fascination in documenting his direct experience of people and the land.\n\nMohamed has been creating photobook dummies and we are pleased he will also be sharing and talking about his thoughts and processes for making these.\n\nMohamed has been shortlisted for several awards and competitions and his work has been exhibited at the prestigious Mission Gallery, the Waterfront National Museum in Wales the Trajectory Showcase Competition Exhibition in Shoreditch, London, Nova Cymru 2018, and a portrait was included in the Taylor Wessing Photographic Portrait exhibition 2018 at the National Portrait Gallery in London.\n\nMore recently Mohamed has exhibited 4 images in ‘Facing Britain’, curated by Ralph Goertz at Kunsthalle Darmstadt Museum Goch – touring to Koslar and Krakow in 2022. In Wales, the ‘Many Voices, One Nation 2’ exhibition supported by the Senedd and exhibiting at Ffotogallery included 11 of his images and he has also had 5 images included in the Oriel Davies ‘Responding to Rembrandt’ exhibition.\n\nTHURSDAY 14th MARCH\n\nRICHARD BILLINGHAM \n\nTICKETS – SOLD OUT!\n\n{{IMAGE 55}}\n\nRichard Billingham (born 25 September 1970) is an English photographer and artist, film maker and art teacher. His work has mostly concerned his family, the place he grew up in the West Midlands, but also landscapes elsewhere.\n\nBillingham is best known for the Photobook Ray’s A Laugh (1996), which documents the life of his alcoholic father Ray, and obese, heavily tattooed mother Liz. Billingham adapted this into his first feature film, Ray & Liz (2018), a memoir of his childhood.\n\n{{IMAGE 56}}\n\nHe won the 1997 Citibank Private Bank Photography Prize (now Deutsche Börse Photography Prize) and was shortlisted for the 2001 Turner Prize.

If we photographed you, come and see your photograph in the exhibition! If we didn’t, we’re sorry to have missed you but why not pop in and see how many people you recognise or know…\n\nTowards the end of 2023, Oriel Colwyn and The Northern Eye Photography Festival worked with photographer Mark McNulty to create a new archive and exhibition. During the October half-term we set up a free pop-up studio in the Bayview Shopping Centre and photographed passers-by over a period of four days. The full set of these images are currently being exhibited in the foyer of the Coed Pella council building in Colwyn Bay. ({{LINK 1}}A Bay View)\n\nSeeing the joy and engagement this exhibition is bringing to both our community and visitors alike, we looked at ways of adding to and extending this exhibition. Primarily we wanted to meet and engage with more people and also offer the chance for them to be included in the exhibition.\n\nSo, six months after taking the original photographs we set up our pop-up studio again, this time in a borrowed gazebo on Colwyn Bay’s prom for a unique and busy weekend.\n\nOn the Saturday we photographed people who were visiting the town’s Prom Xtra event. Prom Xtra is an annual family event, which takes place on Colwyn Bay Promenade. It attracts thousands of people and fills a 1km long site with free family activities, live entertainment, charity stalls and fairground attractions… and this year…us!\n\n{{IMAGE 2}}\nJacob, Alfie & Archie, Prom Xtra, 2024 ©Mark McNulty\n\nProm Xtra is an event where the community comes together for a fun day to remember, it is a community centred event with many attendees coming from the Bay of Colwyn area whilst also attracting day visitors from across North Wales and beyond. \n\nWe thought this was a perfect opportunity for us to add to and include more people into the Bay View portrait archive.\n\n{{IMAGE 3}}\nLouise, Prom Xtra, May 2024 ©Mark McNulty\n\nThe following day (Sunday), we built the gazebo and set up the studio again, this time in readiness for Colwyn Bay Pride. \n\nWith the town’s Pride event now in its second year, the event planned to showcase the “vibrant spirit and resilience” of the LGBTQ+ community in Colwyn Bay and build on the success of its inaugural event. Pride event manager Kia Davies said “Colwyn Bay Pride is about more than just a single day of celebration – it’s about fostering a sense of belonging and acceptance within our community,“\n\n{{IMAGE 4}}\nGutterslut & Jacques, Colwyn Bay Pride, May 2024 ©Mark McNulty\n\nAgain, we saw this as an ideal opportunity for us to work with, and include more people into the Bay View project in celebration of our town.\n\n{{IMAGE 5}}\nAison, Colwyn Bay Pride, May 2024 ©Mark McNulty\n\nOver the weekend we met so many brilliant people and photographed an amazing 640 of you! We had great fun and were glad to meet so many people at the events – thank you to all who took part.\n\n‘A Bay View’ initially started off as a way to honour Daniel Meadows’ and his historic work from 1973 ‘The Free Photographic Omnibus’, but it has grown into a wonderful and unique record of life in Colwyn Bay in 2023/24. \n\nTo allow you to see the full show in its entirety we have combined the original exhibition with the new portraits, and the whole archive can now be seen at the PORTH EIRIAS building on the Colwyn Bay prom.\n\n{{LINK 2}}www.markmcnulty.co.uk\n\n \n\n"

    "body": "\n\nSteve Starr – Coastal Encounters, Reflecting on Appearances & Associations\n \n\n12/03/24 – 26/04/24\n\n{{IMAGE 1}}\n\n“I am sixty-five years old; I feel the seat belt pulling across my chest as I drive a white Skoda hatchback along New Brighton promenade. A child scoots ahead of her family as they make their way along the promenade walkway. Driving past Morrisons hectic supermarket and the fading Adventureland amusements, I make a left turn to park my car as close as possible to Fort Perch Rock. Finding my parking space, I can just see New Brighton lighthouse appearing around the side of the Fort. As a ritual I have observed many times before, I will once more make a photograph of this elegant lighthouse.”\n\n{{IMAGE 2}}\n\nSteve Starr is inexorably drawn to areas of this local coastline, as well as its estuaries, river banks and canals leading out to sea. Reflecting on appearances & associations, Steve follows a linear exploration from his home in Heswall on the Wirral, and makes his way along the coastline to Llandudno. \n\n{{IMAGE 3}}\n\nObserving the region’s coast during the previous six years, many objects placed there by humanity were encountered, and photographs were made to document them.\n\n{{IMAGE 4}}\n\nAt the coast, one cannot help but take notice of the surroundings. The senses are filled, the air even on a still day, is perfumed with ozone. The sound of the waves crashing, the plaintive call of seagulls in flight, passing vessels making their low thunder, as propellers cavitate within the murky water. People too are making noise; adult’s muffled chatter underlying the yelps of joy of children enjoying the seaside atmosphere. Walk away from the seaside though, and you carry something with you, not just the remnants of the clear head instilled by the sea air, but the salt which stays with you, you can feel it on your clothes, in your hair and on your skin, like a parting salty kiss to the lips, sustaining you until your next dalliance. \n\nObservations made around the coast will tend to point at natural phenomenon; the sun, sea, sky, sand, rocks and all the life managing to exist deep in the turbulent sea and upon the breeze. Take another look though, and there is a plethora of objects placed around the coast by humankind, familiar in appearance, from the obvious lighthouses, promenades, seaside shelters and abandoned boats down to the incidental litter bins, bollards and lifebuoys. Slipping into a meditation around these objects, it may bring to mind various thoughts and feelings, it may seem conflicting that a mere object might cause us to emote like this, but that’s exactly what associations can do to us, when we correlate a familiar appearance with a real memory or maybe an imagined scenario. \n\n{{IMAGE 5}}\n\nIn the same way that on old photograph might bring back childhood memories, and not just those memories brought on by that which is directly visible in the photograph, but memories from all sorts of indirect associations brought on by a photographs content, perhaps also memories of the photograph as an article in its own right. \n\nObserving a seaside shelter on the coast might remind us of an old family holiday, the associations sending us on a reverie of good times past, speaking to us directly of our own experience. Then what of an old abandoned boat, which we have never known before, yet being in the presence of such an object draws us in, to be aware of the imagined life of the boat and its previous owners, each broken timber, smashed window and curl of peeling paint enabling us to add bright detail to our imagined life of the boat. An experience purely brought on by appearances and the associations we make, an extrapolation made in our minds to a previous life of the object, we base it on a handful of observations and our imagination completes what we think might have happened, filling in the gaps. \n\n{{IMAGE 6}}\n\nMaking photographs of such objects stumbled upon around the coast, leads to further associations. When printed and the photograph is experienced perhaps in the comfort of our favourite armchair, an opportunity exists to look at the appearance of the photograph. \n\nA traditional photograph is typically just a piece of paper, with a thin resin-based layer containing light sensitive silver salts, and it is in this layer that we see the printed image. So now the appearance is that of an image on a piece of paper. In the armchair we are not in the presence of the subject photographed, yet we can still make associations with the subject, also we can make associations with the photograph as an object. Thinking of those photographs that have been passed down through the family, those photographs acquire their own history separate from the image they support, or possibly there are combined associations made of both the photograph and the subject the photograph contains. \n\n{{IMAGE 7}}\n\nWhen the subject of a photograph eventually ages, succumbs to the elements, or is knocked down by the developers, the photograph’s subject may no longer exist, a photograph of the subject though may persist through time. Allowing us to witness the object once more, assess its appearance and through our own experience make new associations. \n\n \n\n"

TISH follows her daughter revisiting key images and moments in her mother’s life to establish her legacy.\n\nAs a working class photographer from the North East, Tish felt an obligation to the people and problems within her local environment, and used documentary photography to highlight and challenge the social disadvantages she herself suffered. Unlike many social documentary photographers, Tish was from the same streets as the people she photographed, lending a poignant intimacy to her stark yet tender black and white images. However, despite early acclaim for her work, she was unable to make a living from photography and was unable to escape the poverty she documented.

In this feature documentary we follow Tish’s daughter, Ella, as she opens up her mother’s archive for the first time on screen to reveal a treasure trove of unseen images, artefacts, letters and diaries. Ella takes to the road to meet people who knew Tish and ask why she did not receive more recognition in her lifetime.\n\nIn digging into the past, Ella comes to terms with her own grief at her mother’s passing and reconnects with family members not seen in years. By shining a light on a working class artist who went largely unrecognised in her lifetime, the documentary questions the value placed on working class people both in the past and present day.\n\n{{LINK 4}}{{IMAGE 4}}\nKids Jumping On To Mattresses – Youth Unemployment (1981) Tish Murtha (c) Ella Murtha, all rights reserved.\n\n“Tish Murtha, who lived a life as tough as those she shot in different eras of deprivation and marginalisation, receives a wholehearted and riveting tribute” The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw\n\n“Details leap out from the photographs, not just the faces of those she captured, but the twist of cigarette smoke, metal ashtrays recalling the tang of wet ash, plasters on scrubbed knees” Eye for Film\n\n“An authentic insight into the devastating impact of unemployment and poverty” Screen International\n\n“Paul Sng’s intimate documentary resurrects a fleeting art radical, honouring her incisive political views as well as her photographs”  Sight and Sound\n\n{{LINK 5}}BOOK TICKETS\n\nAdvance Tickets for the screening are priced at £6 (£8 on the day)\n\nOur aim is to keep the tickets prices for the film screenings as low as we possibly can to open up the screening for more people… BUT… we do need to cover the cost of the film screening in the cinema, SO…  If you are in the position to help out a little more, please do consider making an extra donation to Oriel Colwyn at checkout.\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge Ffilm Cymru Wales for supporting our regular Photo Film Club screenings.\n\n \n\n"

    "body": "\n\nLlandrillo FdA Photography Show 2024\n \n\nEach year, Oriel Colwyn takes the opportunity to support and showcase the final show group exhibitions from students completing Llandrillo College’s FdA and BA(Hons) Photography courses.\n\nIn February we introduce you to the work of the 2nd year FdA students: \n\nTheir show evidences the various genres of photography that exists within the group, as well as identifying the importance of working together to coordinate a meaningful photographic exhibition.\n\nOpening 6.30pm – Friday 02nd February – ALL WELCOME – Free \n\nThe show then runs until 2nd March\n\nFeaturing:\n\nAnnabella Crisan\n\n“My name is Annabella Crisan and I have lived in North Wales since 2018. I moved here with my husband and two children from Romania where I had worked as a professional administrator on European Union capital funding projects. The Romanian political system and economy became increasingly unstable which ultimately led to job threats, so as a family, we took the huge decision to move to the UK. Having settled in Colwyn Bay, which I love, I decided to begin a new life and to follow a dream of mine which is photography. I signed up for FdA Photography at Coleg Llandrillo 18 months ago and have not looked back since. My passion in photography is travel, but my real ambition is to work as a professional commercial photographer.\n\nMy current project and what you see on the walls here is part of my architectural work which I would like to develop into a specialism. Architectural photography is a very precise discipline and has evolved from the conventions of architectural drawing and draughtsmanship. In high end work, special technical cameras are used to adjust perspective so that vertical lines of the building are recorded without convergence. lighting is also critical and so planning the shoot to make sure that the key facade is illuminated is part of the preparation. I am working digitally with 35mm SLR with wide angle lenses that make it possible to adhere to the conventions.”\n\n{{IMAGE 1}}\n© Annabella Crisan\n\nGeorgiana Bruma\n\n“I was born in Iasi, Romania in 1988. Nicolae Ceausescu was holding onto power, and it was one year before the fall of communism that followed the Soviet restructuring program known as Perestroika. I don’t remember any of it, but my life has been totally coloured by those events. You could say I was lucky, but if you listened to many of the older generation who lived under Soviet rule in a ‘communist society’, then you might say I was unlucky.\n\nMy work focuses on a village not far from Iasi where my husband’s family are from. When we go back there, I realise more and more how distinct it is and how important it is to me. When I lived in Romania, it was all I knew, and so everything was familiar and taken for granted. Now, I see it differently. All the nuances of national and cultural identity are present in all things that surround me. The vernacular buildings of areas that speak of a way of life. The wooden glazed day rooms with French doors and lace curtains that circulate the breeze on hot summer days. The garden gates were left open for passers by on a summer’s evening – an invitation to stop and chat, to catch up on local news and share concerns on welfare and village life.”\n\n{{IMAGE 2}}\n© Georgiana Bruma\n\nKay Chester\n\n“I was born in Plymouth, Devon and In 1982 I moved to Nijmegen and lived there for 18 years. My children and grandchildren are Dutch-born and speak English with a pronounced Dutch accent. Like many women, photography began in this domestic context when I started photographing my children, family and friends as a record of life’s social journey. I loved looking for the moment, the expression or the gesture that would frame the event. I realised that I had a passion for photography and upon returning to the UK, I committed to enrol at college for a Foundation Degree in Photography,\n\nWhen I started this course, I explored traditional avenues that I thought belonged to the world of professional photography. Living in North Wales and surrounded by wonderful countryside, it was an obvious starting point to venture out into the landscape. I have always been an avid walker and using the camera to explore the hills and woodlands was and is, an absolute joy, but the idea of myself as an intrepid explorer of the wilderness is far removed from the person I am.  It was some time before I got to street photography and I had not imagined how much I would enjoy it.\n\nI am aware that photographing people in public spaces without their agreement raises moral and ethical concerns. However, we have a responsibility to document our world and argue for the liberty of the state to apply to its people.  Imagine a world where we were constantly being observed, but we were denied the privilege of observing ourselves.”\n\n{{IMAGE 3}}\n© Kay Chester\n\nKerri Cooper\n\n“I have been photographing a house that was abandoned many years ago following the passing of the elderly couple whose home it once was. Everything was left just as it was, and because of its location, it has remained largely undisturbed for many years. The story of their lives is still contained in the fabric of the interior, a story unresolved, fixed in  liminality, slowly decaying as the building deteriorates and the weather finds its way in. As a mirror to this peculiarity, I have also been photographing the interior of a former care-home, that somehow seems to have shared a similar fate, although the demise was a result of fire rather than the end of a life. The building was initially boarded up and put up for sale, but years passed and the building eventually deteriorated to the point of abandon.The contents offers a peculiar mix of personal belongings and bric-a-brac institutional furniture, mixed in with broken care industry apparatus.”\n\n{{IMAGE 4}}\n© Kerri Cooper\n\nLaura Broughton\n\n“My name is Laura Broughton, I am 34 years young. I currently live in Mochdre, but I grew up living in Old Colwyn so I know and love this area very well. I live with my four children, Leo, Ruby, Marnie and Phoebe. I am a care assistant in a residential nursing home and I am also a full time student, studying photography.\n\nThroughout my adult life I have suffered with depression.\n\nOften people have asked me why I’m depressed, or why I can’t just be happy? and the honest answer to that is, I don’t know. People have said “you look ok” and I guess I do but it is something people hide very well.\n\nIt’s incredibly hard to put into words how it feels to have depression. It took me a long time to even think that depression could be the subject of my work, but the more I thought about it, the more I could see myself as a complex individual that manages to contradict the generalities that people associate with depression. I am not a hopeless person, even though I feel it at times, In fact, I would say that I am a driven person and that I work incredibly hard to be a good parent and to keep everything together, but all of that seems to be outside of my personality when I find the time to be with myself. There seems to be a disconnect between the person I am to others, and the person I am to myself.\n\nMy photography and filmmaking is an expression of these feelings and is the beginning of an investigation into the subject of depression, in both creative and psychological terms. The subject is vast and so context is often the key to understanding the personal nuances of particular forms of depression. I hope to be able to continue my studies to achieve BA(Hons) Photography next year, and to develop my work through further research and practice.”\n\n{{IMAGE 5}}\n© Laura Broughton\n\n \n\n"

    "body": "\n\nSpeakers Selection – Group Exhibition\n \n\n07/10/23 – 31/12/23\n\nA selection of works from the Northern Eye Festival speakers, exhibited in the main Oriel Colwyn gallery.\n\nJILLIAN EDELSTEIN – TRUTH AND LIES\n\n{{IMAGE 1}}\nMrs Seipei and Jerry Richardson – ©Jillian Edelstein – Jerry Richardson was the man who murdered her son, Stompie, when he was leader of Winnie Mandela football club.\n\nStories from The Truth and Reconciliation Commission in South Africa.\n\n“Can you combine justice with forgiveness?” – In April 1996 an extraordinary process began in South Africa. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission, under its chairman Archbishop Desmond Tutu, held its first public hearings to investigate over thirty years of human rights violations under apartheid. The Commission had been founded in the belief that truth was the only means by which the people of South Africa could come to a common understanding of their past, and that this understanding was necessary if the country was to forge a new national identity in the future. In the first two years more than 20,000 victims made statements to the commissioners and, encouraged by the possibility of amnesty, some 7,000 perpetrators came forward to confess their crimes.” This work tells some of their stories. It is unique in that it puts faces to the personal testimonies of both victims and perpetrators. In the most direct way it documents one of the most important experiments in democratic justice attempted in the 20th century.\n\nDANIEL MEADOWS – FACTORY RECORDS 1979-1980\n\n{{IMAGE 2}}\nIan Curtis of Joy Division on stage at New Osbourne Club, Miles Platting, Manchester. 7th February 1980 ©Daniel Meadows\n\nFrom 1978 to 1980, Daniel Meadows worked for Granada TV in Manchester, first as a local programmes researcher and later also as an occasional presenter on the regional arts review programme Celebration; all the while keeping alive his photographic practice.\n\n“One of my TV colleagues was Granada Reports presenter Tony Wilson who, at that time, was busy setting up Factory Records with Alan Erasmus. While working for What’s On — Celebration’s predecessor in the arts slot — I photographed a Factory Night in Hulme, hosted by Tony Wilson and Russell Club promoter Alan Wise, which featured Buzzcocks and John Cooper Clarke. Tony liked what I did and began inviting me along to gigs and recording sessions to take more photographs of his artists and bands: Ian Curtis and Bernard Sumner of Joy Division, Vini Reilly of The Durutti Column, and A Certain Ratio.”\n\n“On Tuesday 8 January 1980 I photographed Joy Division’s session with producer Martin Hannett at Pennine Sound Studio in Oldham where they recorded an early version of Love Will Tear Us Apart (later used on the B-side of the 7″ single FAC 23).”\n\n“I also photographed Joy Division on stage at the New Osbourne Club in Miles Platting, a gig where Jon Savage — who later became famous for his writing, broadcasting and music journalism, in particular his 1991 book England’s Dreaming, Sex Pistols and Punk Rock — was DJing.”\n\nJANE HILTON – DRAG QUEEN COWBOYS\n\n{{IMAGE 3}}\nDrag Queen Cowboys – ©Jane Hilton\n\nThis ongoing project which Jane Hilton was working on before lockdown (2020), was short-listed for the Sony World Photography Awards 2021. These incredible performers collaborated with Jane to make a series of portraits. Inspired by Hollywood’s portrayal of the Western genre, and ‘The Misfits’ (1961) written by Arthur Miller, starring Marilyn Monroe and Clark Gable.\n\nThis series juxtaposes the romanticism of the West and its rugged cowboys, with its displacement of characters seen in this film. After a bit of persuasion these artists bravely stepped away from their natural habitat of clubs and bars, into the natural light of the American West. All shot on a 5×4 plate camera with black and white film, and no re-touching. It was a leap of faith…\n\n JANE HILTON – DEAD EAGLE TRAIL\n\n{{IMAGE 4}}\nDead Eagle Trail – ©Jane Hilton\n\n A series of cowboy portraits from the ‘buckaroos’ of Nevada to the ‘cowpunchers’ of Arizona.\n\nJane Hiltons first visit to North America was to Arizona in 1988. The enormous wide-open spaces, desert highways, and vast skies were the biggest contrast she had ever experienced to growing up in suburban England. This, combined with the warm memories of spending Sunday afternoons watching westerns with her father has contributed to Hiltons affection for the wild west. Dead Eagle Trail is a culmination of numerous road trips Jane Hilton has taken across the States whilst documenting the American culture. Cowboys are photographed in their own homes, surrounded by western artifacts. The need to hold onto their heritage is clearly visible.\n\nAYESHA JONES – WHERE DO YOU COME FROM? / MOTHERLAND\n\n{{IMAGE 5}}\n©Ayesha Jones\n\nWhere do you come from? – Is a project that has been inspired by Ayesha’s experiences as a young woman born in England to a white father (Welsh heritage) and a black mother (Caribbean heritage).\n\nBeing asked to explain where she comes from, on a regular basis (due to her brown tones) has led Ayesha to ask that question a bit deeper and attempt to uncover the hidden stories in my own heritage.\n\n“Exploring my own family history has shown me how connected we all are to each other. If we go back far enough, we probably all come from the same place, at some point in time!”\n\n‘Where Do You Come From’ is a project that documents the process of reconnecting to Ayesha’s roots. “I take a look back at the routes my ancestors took. I also document my own experiences so that my decedents can appreciate how they came to be (wherever that may be) and understand where they came from too.”\n\n“To move in the right direction, you must have an understanding of where you are coming from and where you are going towards.”\n\nMotherland – “Leading on from my project ‘Where Do You Come From’, Motherland documents mine and my mother’s experiences visiting West Africa, as we attempt to reconnect even deeper with my maternal lineage.”\n\n“I also ended up living in Ouagadougou for over a year and having my first child, before returning to the UK in December 2017. Images were captured over the course of three years, as we were being initiated into Dogon philosophies and experiencing traditional rituals.”\n\n“Using photography, Motherland explores themes around black female identity, dual heritage identity, ritual abuse, well-being, belonging, animism, and motherhood.”\n\n“I travel to the motherland and back again, only to realise that belonging is a state of mind and not a physical location or social group.”\n\n \n\n"

Starting out in his early years as an assistant at Reflex Agency, he quickly became one of Britain’s leading reportage photographers through his work in documenting the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. \n\nHis continued curiosity in the world around him led Hurn to become part of the British and American social revolution of the 1960s, photographing many iconic figures from film and music, including The Beatles, Sean Connery, and Jane Fonda. In 1967 he joined Magnum Photo agency as a full member.\n\nAs well as being internationally renowned for his photographic work, David Hurn is also famous for having set up the School for Documentary Photography in Newport, Wales. After leaving in 1989, Hurn eventually turned away from documentary photojournalism to create work with a more personal approach, which he still creates today from his home in Tintern, Wales.\n\nDavid Hurn has been photographing Wales – the people, landscape and culture – for over fifty years and continues to do so today as one of the longest serving members of the renowned Magnum Photos Agency. \n\nThis unique tailor-made exhibition of thirty photographs, all made within a thirty mile radius of Oriel Colwyn Gallery, provides a glimpse of north Wales captured in the preferred style of one of Britain’s most respected living documentary photographers.\n\n“In the early 1970’s I returned from a hectic life in London to my home base in Cardiff, Wales, ostensibly to rest.\n\nI enjoyed my time so much that I decided to stay, buy a cottage and spend one third of my future life photographing and trying to ‘discover my culture’.”\n\n{{IMAGE 2}}\nG.B. WALES. 1997. Snowdonia. Sheep shearing. © David Hurn/MAGNUM PHOTOS\n\n“As always on a new project, I mapped out a ‘spiders web’ of very simplistic possibilities. Not so much as a bible but more of a safety net to make sure I didn’t stray too far in obscure directions.”\n\n{{IMAGE 3}}\n© David Hurn\n\n“I had no interest in particular areas as such but was interested in work, sport, education, landscape etc, wherever that led me i.e. life as I saw it.”\n\n{{IMAGE 4}}\nG.B. WALES. 1986. Rhyl. The Sun Centre. © David Hurn/MAGNUM PHOTOS\n\n“After fifty years of shooting I found that there was no spot in Wales from which I couldn’t make an exhibition within a twenty-five mile radius of that point – except the north coast…\n\n …my excuse is half is water, thus the slight cheat: 30 Mile Radius.”\n – David Hurn – May 2023\n\nExhibition Opening – Saturday 17th June (4pm – 6pm)\n\nWe are pleased to welcome DAVID HURN to the ‘30 Mile Radius’ Exhibition opening.\n\nAM DDIM // FREE –  Croeso i bawb  // All Welcome\n\n \n\nDAVID HURN – Photographers Talk\n\n‘How To When Floundering’ \n\nSunday 18th June – 12pm (11.30am doors)\n\nAs the talk will be in the main gallery space, numbers will be limited.\n\nLimited Ticket Event (Please book your place in advance.)\n\n{{LINK 2}}Book Ticket – Minimum Donation of £8\n\n(Once you have booked your space, there is also an option to guarantee your copy of the exhibition ‘Catalog’ – scroll down for the option at checkout – only 1 per person please.)\n\n{{IMAGE 5}}\n\nWe are pleased to announce Oriel Colwyn has collaborated with David Hurn and Offline Journal on the first of the new catalog exhibition publications announced in the latest issue #010 of Offline Journal. \n\nVery limited copies of a forty-page catalog published for the exhibition will be available at Oriel Colwyn during the opening on 17th June or via Sunday’s talk booking page.\n\n{{LINK 3}}Join Mailing List\n\n{{IMAGE 6}}\n\n \n\n"

He documented the Beats, Welsh coal miners, Peruvian Indians, The Stones, London bankers, and the Americans. This is the bumpy ride, revealed with unblinking honesty by the reclusive artist himself. Photo of Robert Frank by Lisa Rinzler, copyright Assemblage Films LLC Even Robert Frank’s friends will tell you that he was difficult. One of the most influential figures in the worlds of photography and independent filmmaking, Frank was never easily approachable.  For over six decades he held steadfast to a singular vision and earned widespread acclaim without forsaking his outsider status. Photo Eye Collage by Robert Frank, copyright Robert Frank Don't Blink follows Frank from his early family life in Switzerland to his reluctance to embrace celebrity status in New York to his eventual quest for solitude in a remote corner of Nova Scotia, Canada. A series of personal tragedies pushed Frank to painfully explore complex feelings about family and friends, memory and loss, acceptance of change, and loneliness. Don't Blink offers audiences revelatory insight into the intricacies of his photos, films and personal history while artfully revealing Robert Frank’s complex life story. Photo in Robert Frank’s studio by Lisa Rinzler, copyright Assemblage Films LLC The life and work of Robert Frank—as a photographer and a filmmaker—are so intertwined that they’re one in the same, and the vast amount of territory he’s covered, from The Americans in 1958 up to his death 2019, is intimately registered in his now formidable body of artistic gestures. From the early ’90s on, Frank had been making his films and videos with the brilliant editor Laura Israel, who has helped him to keep things homemade and preserve the illuminating spark of first contact between camera and people/places. Don’t Blink is Israel’s like-minded portrait of her friend and collaborator, a lively mix of images and sounds and recollected passages and unfathomable losses and friendships that leaves us a fast and fleeting imprint of the life of the Swiss-born man who reinvented himself the American way.                                                                                         – New York Film Festival description Photo of Robert Frank by Sid Kaplan from contact sheet, copyright Sid Kaplan {{LINK 2}}Get Tickets  We gratefully acknowledge Ffilm Cymru Wales support for our regular Photo Film Club screenings. \n \n \n\n"

From this initial contact, we communicated over the next few weeks, I was surprised by her enthusiasm to pursue the concept, discovering that she was a dancer and choreographer and wanted to seize the opportunity to give herself a voice to express her emotions.As an artist, my aim is to capture the powerful emotional impact that dance can have as a medium of expression. Through this piece, I hope to bring attention to the struggles of refugees who have had to flee their homes due to war and conflict.The photographs I have captured document the raw and powerful emotions that can come from using movement to express complex feelings. The subject of the photographs is a Ukrainian woman who uses her movement to express her sadness, fear, and longing for her family that is still in Ukraine.Each location that we chose for the photographs represents a different aspect of the experience of being a refugee. In one of the photographs, the subject is standing amidst an abandoned industrial building, highlighting the sense of isolation and loneliness that comes with being a stranger in a foreign land. In other photographs, she is posing amidst breath-taking natural scenery, which serves as a reminder of the beauty that exists in the world despite the pain and suffering caused by war.The photos are not just aesthetically pleasing, but possess a deeper meaning that encourages the viewer to reflect on the harsh realities of the world we live in. As an artist, I hope my work inspires a sense of empathy and solidarity with people who have been forced to leave their homes due to war and conflict.  Thomas Wyn JonesAs a photographer, my work is focused on documenting the effects of economic decline in Anglesey, a small island off the coast of Wales. Through my lens, I aim to capture the complex social and economic challenges facing this community, and to bear witness to the human impact of these changes.My images capture the abandoned factories, crumbling buildings, and empty storefronts that serve as symbols of a once-thriving economy that has fallen on hard times. But my work is not just about decay and loss - it is also about resilience and the power of community to come together in the face of adversity.By bringing attention to these issues through my photography, I hope to spark conversation and inspire action towards a more just and equitable future for all. I believe that art can serve as a powerful tool for social change, and I am committed to using my skills to tell the stories that need to be told, and to create a space for reflection and dialogue around issues that are often overlooked or ignored.Through my work, I hope to challenge viewers to consider their own role in shaping the world around them, and to recognize the interconnectedness of all communities, both local and global. \"   Sophie BeddowThemThe world is ever changing and with it, fashion must adapt and grow with the changes. Gender and identity politics have come to the forefront of societal issues in call of equality and justice for those in the LGBTQ+ community whom have long been overlooked. Fashion has reflected this through many favoured publications.Them takes a look at these ideologies from a fashion point of view, separating gender and identity through clothing. In two of the photographs, the model is obscured. This allows for no judgment to be passed on said model’s gender. While the remaining images offer a view of each models face. While one can make judgments upon the person’s gender - even on a subconscious level- it is still impossible to tell how one identifies themselves through a single image.The photographs on display are a part of an on-going project. If you would like to take part [provided you visit on the 11th of May] grab an item of clothing from one of the mannequins, take your place in front of the backdrop and have your photo taken.  Connor WilliamsThe image of any god in our own likeness is what in marketing parlance may be referred to as personification - or to put it another way, we make our gods in our own likeness. The gym has become the sanctuary of sacrificial offerings where no pain, no gain, is the mantra that drives us towards a nirvana of honed physical perfection.As a documentary photographer, I have captured the creation of a God Complex in a modern bodybuilder, which compared to ancient gods and deities from the past, share many similarities.   Kev CurtisBreaking the fourth wallA celebration of the independent and alternative entertainment scene in North Wales.From October 2022 to March 2023 I set out to capture various independent artists in order to highlight the incredible diversity of talent that exists away from the limelight of the larger commercial venues in the region.  This six month window of activity features artists such as magicians, circus performers, burlesque, showgirl and cabaret performers, vertical dancers, the Rhyl Comedy Club, various am dram groups, the late Chris Somerville from the Harlequin Puppet Theatre, and Sam the Llandudno Monkey Man, amongst many others.Despite the limited resources and funding at their disposal, they all operate with the same degree of passion, drive, and energy as their more financially successful counterparts on the professional showbiz circuit.  Beyond the gaze of mainstream public awareness, this is my attempt to give this niche corner of the industry a voice and a share of the spotlight which so often can be fleeting.  To supplement the framed pictures on the walls, there is also a large photobook to flick through that contains extra photographs and personal statements from many of the performers.Originally from England, I have been living in Colwyn Bay since 2011.  This academic year sees the culmination of four years of study at Llandrillo College: three years to achieve a distinction in a foundation degree in photography, with an add-on year to convert it to an honours degree.  Having been a musician for 40+ years (I used to compose music for TV programmes and I'm now currently the bassist in Pinc Ffloyd, a Pink Floyd tribute band), it is unsurprising that I have gravitated toward the sphere of live entertainment; the focus being on capturing the drama, atmosphere, and excitement of live performance.   Hari Cenin RobertsMy true interest in photography centres on the peculiarity of transfer that exists between the real, and the rendering of the real in two dimensions. To ignore the nature of the object in its true physicality, and focus instead on its potential as a representation that loses connection to its volume, whilst at the same time gaining something else in its re-invention.It’s the gain that fascinates me, how something is still recognisable for what it is, but now brings something else to the table for our consideration. To put it another way - to photograph something in a way that reveals more than what I was confronted with at the scene itself.         \n \n \n\n"

In partnership with Nerys Veldhuizen, Cartrefi Conwy’s former Older Persons Engagement Coordinator their vision was to give older tenants the chance to shine in the spotlight and tell their stories. The participants were photographed in their own homes by renowned portrait photographer Niall McDiarmid. These portraits are not just photographs but are part of each tenant’s story. Photographs were also made of items precious to each of the tenants and their stories and conversations gathered by local writer and storyteller Gillian Brownson. The images and texts allow the tenants to tell their stories and share with you a little about their lives. Anne & Little Anne - ©Niall McDiarmid - \"There’s sadness, but there’s wonderful things that happen. We’re such good friends.\" These portraits also form part of a storybook to bring the photographs to life.Paul Sampson, Curator of Oriel Colwyn states: “We wanted to shine a light on the life stories of senior community members and showcase some of their incredible stories. The goal was to highlight how much they have contributed to the community that we live in today and how much they still continue to contribute to society.” Tony ©Niall McDiarmid - \"I was very, very happy and made friendships I even have today. There was only a hundred made, they were very special.\" “We called the exhibition This is Me because it was their chance to show who they are, what they are about and demonstrate what is important to them.”Nerys agreed that it was time for older members of the population to have an opportunity in the spotlight.She said: “Too often when people get to a certain age they become invisible to younger eyes. People are so concerned with their own lives and activities that they can forget that the older generation still has a vital role in helping make a community thrive and that they still have interests, hobbies, dreams and ambitions no matter what their age.” Marian - ©Niall McDiarmid - “I took a year out. So many adventures! I don’t want to give in, I’ve got to have a life. The secret is, don’t ever totally grow up!” {{LINK 1}}VIEW - FULL IMAGES AND STORIES HERE THIS IS ME wouldn’t have been possible without the Culture Step funding and we are thankful to Arts and Business Cymru for getting firmly behind the project.  \n \n \n\n"

Beginning with a new-born blessing and ending with a son’s farewell at his mothers’ remembrance service, what we see in between is a glimpse into people’s private and public lives – the different cultures, the dual identities, the religions, the celebrations, the music, the achievements, the actions for change and the personal stories that bind us all. Africa Day - Rodney Parade, Newport - ©Glenn Edwards Photojournalist Glenn Edwards, awarded press photographer of the year has travelled widely documenting for national and international news organisations including The Times and The Independent.

His meticulously composed, large-scale images are stunning narratives of small-town American life--moviescapes crystallized into a single frame.  While the photographs are staged with crews that rival many feature film productions, Crewdson takes inspiration as much from his own dreams and fantasies as the worlds of Alfred Hitchcock, David Lynch, Edward Hopper and Diane Arbus. Crewdson's imagery has also infiltrated the pop culture landscape--including his inimitable Six Feet Under ads and Yo La Tengo album art. Shot over a decade with unprecedented access, Gregory Crewdson: Brief Encounters beautifully bares the artist's process--and it's as mesmerizing and riveting as the images themselves.   {{LINK 2}}Get Tickets   We gratefully acknowledge Ffilm Cymru Wales support for our regular Photo Film Club screenings. \n \n \n\n"

The name was agreed upon as it describes the mixture of various characters, interests and working style within the group.This show evidences the various genres of photography that exists within the group, as well as identifying the importance of working together to coordinate a meaningful photographic exhibition.Hybrid features work from 10 students: Malcolm Roberts I am from Capel Garmon in the Conwy Valley and I am a mature student on the Fda Photography Course at Llandrillo College.Title - Monumenta building, structure, or site that is of historical importance or interest.I have captured images of structures and site’s that have become monuments to disasters, tragedies and adversity throughout the years.  Caitlin Millership I like to take fashion images. I have recently started using a projector to project images onto models has been a really fun experience and I love how all the photos I have taken have been coming out. I find using a projector helps me to feel more creative and experimental with taking photos which helps me to produce good quality images that I want to share.    Rhiannon WilliamsFirst off I consider myself an illustrator before a photographer. My images haven't been drawn on however I have made them look like they have been drawn by using a filter over them to have a heavy black and white contrast. I wanted my images to look like a Japanese comic book style as I draw a lot of inspiration from them even for my personal work.   Hollie WilliamsI’m a 20 year old photographer currently studying at Colleg Llandrillo , in rhos-on-sea. My current work consists of a mixture of editorial and high fashion along with headshots. I do most of my work from a studio as I love the creative freedom it gives me and I’m very pleased with the work that has come out of it from the past year.   Raymond DolleryI am a mature student, the images are of my journey after going virtually blind in my right eye due to glaucoma that is in both eyes. I also had cataracts in both eyes so I had an operation on my left eye to remove the cataract and have a new lens placed in the eye.   Stephen Atmore I am a mature student who came to photography late in life, my images can be seen as quite abstract, with movement and colour.   Rew Molloy The most recent development in my work is to shift my focus towards ‘skater fashion’. Skaters are traditionally associated with  teenage-subculture and their identity, as expressed through baggy workwear clothing,  perceived to sit outside of the mainstream. My approach is to think laterally and to bring a different flavour to the table. I have tried to reimagine the skater as occasionally belonging to a very different order or group. Young aspirational individuals keen to get their clothes from the gentlemen's outfitters as well as the industrial warehouse.   Anton KirbyI am a photographer based in North Wales and I have recently been working on a project called The Car Graveyard which explores both the important influence of car culture in my life, as well as the slow, but sure, inevitable demise that piston-engine cars will come to in the future. By 2030, it's thought we will all be driving electric cars, which is not something imagined as a child. The roar of the V8, the sound of the cinematic car chase, the smell of racing fuel and sheer acceleration of the fuel driven 4 stroke motor will be consigned to history. This marks a significant transition in the evolution of our world and I can see how history marks all of our lives and this is a part of mine I plan to enjoy for as long as I still can.   Jacob WilliamsI am a 20 year old photographer/ videographer based in north wales and the project I have been working on is a short film called Soul Stranded. This film explores the meaning of letting go and moving on from lost relatives. This is driven by my personal experience of losing my Grandy. Making the film has been a cathartic journey in some respects, recognising how the loss has impacted on me, but it also been a real learning experience in relation to filmmaking itself.   Carlos Ortiz Casallas I am 20-years-old Colombian Photography Student currently at Llandrillo College in Rhos-On-Sea on my FdA Photography 2nd year. My work emphazise in dark portraiture and horror-ambience environments, most of them made outdoors.

THE PSYCHO-SPIRITUAL MANTRA OF ROCK is an odyssey into the colorful and bohemian tales of rock 'n' roll's history. A cinematic adventure that delves deep into the mind of one of rock's greatest photographers: Mick Rock. Mick Rock Through the poignant lens of rock 'n' roll mythology; icon-maker, psychedelic explorer, poet, and custodian of dreams Mick Rock navigates his story from the glam rock shimmer of London to the snarl of NYC punk, and deep into the new millennium.  Mick turns inward to face himself and the experiences as the visual record-keeper of myths and legends that propelled him into a living icon in this rock n’ roll comeback story. Mick's now infamous images of the likes of David Bowie, Queen, Syd Barrett (Founding member of Pink Floyd), Blondie, Lou Reed and Iggy Pop are now imprinted on our collective psyche forever and generations to come. David Bowie ©Mick Rock Queen ©Mick Rock Blondie ©Mick Rock Presented in his own words, juxtaposed with spellbinding images and exclusive never-seen or heard archival film footage, audio recordings and original material, this film reveals an enigmatic Rock and his adventurous life both behind the camera and as an integral member of the artist’s entourage working with and shaping some of the most outrageous, recognized and accomplished musicians and personalities of the past forty years. David Bowie, Iggy Pop and Mick Rock ©Mick Rock An icon-maker, and icon in his own right, Rock is among a very few photographers who himself is photographed walking red carpets in Los Angeles, London, New York and around the globe. {{LINK 5}}Get Tickets   WINTER SOUNDS {{LINK 6}} A brand new festival that celebrates live music, sounds and spoken word is coming to Conwy County! From the 25 November to the 4 December 2022 Winter Sounds will be filling venues across the county, shining a light on musical talent from Wales and beyond!Events will be free and reduced cost – For more info click on the image above.  We gratefully acknowledge Ffilm Cymru Wales support for our regular Photo Film Club screenings. \n \n \n\n"

Billingham revisits the figures of his earlier photographs, his alcoholic father Ray, and its impact on Richard and his younger brother Jason.  Billingham, a photographer, previously published the book Ray's a Laugh (1996), with photographs of his family at the time depicted in the film. The photography book became an art world sensation. The candid shots of his family home in a Birmingham tower block were a fascinating clash of chintz, trinkets and something else, more surreal and unpredictable.Ray & Liz was recommended by a regular Photo Film Club attendee (*we are also open to suggestions for future screenings) and it is a great pleasure to announce that we have persuaded Richard to join us in person for a directors Q&A after the film screening.Tickets are usually priced at £5 but we are doing something a little special this screening as a one off...Richard's film is about his difficult childhood growing up with his dysfunctional parents in a Black Country council flat during the Thatcher era. Things were tough then and things are tough now for many.So...

The work was subsequently toured across the U.K. but only shown once briefly within Wales. We are pleased to bring the images back to North Wales and showcase this historic photographic work to new audiences. In 1985 Malcolm Glover bought a second-hand VW camper van and a 125cc motorbike and moved onto a field overlooking Hells Mouth on the Llŷn Peninsula. He felt as if he had been transported back into the 1950s, in part because of its remoteness from urban life.  Man, House, Sea - ©Malcolm Glover Malcolm spent the next year photographing the life of the community through its culture, working life and leisure. These photographs record the rural community of the Llŷn Peninsula.  Carnival Queen Pwllhelli - ©Malcolm Glover There was a huge change in life taking place in the early 1980’s. Huge corporate farms were replacing family run smallholdings.There was also the imminent disappearance of manufacturing industries and the rise of the service industries.  Brass Band Competition ©Malcolm Glover With the onslaught of Thatcherism, which created an irrelevance of the working class and its distinct culture, Malcolm wanted to record this unique place before the inevitable changes transformed its existence and particular culture of that era.  Trevor Man With Sticks - ©Malcolm Glover  \n{{LINK 1}}http://orielcolwyn.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Malcolm-Glover-BBC-Radio-Wales-Sat-Jul-30-2022.mp3 LISTEN: Malcolm Glover - BBC Radio Wales - Sat Jul 30 2022  Ym 1985 derbyniodd Malcolm Glover gyllid gan Awdurdod Datblygu Cymru i dynnu lluniau o Ben Llŷn.  Arddangoswyd y gwaith wedi hynny ledled y DU ond dim ond unwaith am gyfnod byr y bu’n cael ei arddangos yng Nghymru.

Averse to attention, Cunningham finally agreed to step in front of the camera for this documentary.  Fashion photographer and anti-materialist may seem a contradiction in terms but it describes the life of the disarming and always charming New York Times photographer, Bill Cunningham, subject of this highly entertaining documentary.Beginning his fashion career as a milliner in the 1940s, Cunningham discovered what has become a lifelong passion for capturing street fashion on camera. A recognisable figure both on the streets of Manhattan and the catwalks of Paris Fashion Week, his life is as inspiring as is his love of photography. ‘Bill Cunningham New York’ shows the influence, inspiration and fun which street fashion can hold for us all.   Y CLWB FFILM FFOTOMae’n bleser gennym gyhoeddi menter newydd, CLWB FFILM PHOTO a fydd yn dangos am y tro cyntaf erioed ffilm neu raglen ddogfen yn seiliedig ar ffotograffiaeth tua bob 6 wythnos yn sinema hyfryd Theatr Colwyn.Cyfle i wylio ffilm am ffotograffiaeth, cyfarfod hen ffrindiau a gwneud ffrindiau newydd ac yna mynd am ddiod neu bryd o fwyd rhywle yn y dre i gymdeithasu ychydig.Byddwn yn ceisio cadw prisiau tocynnau mor isel â phosibl fel eu bod yn fwy hygyrch.

We have invited participants from the EDGELANDS project to present their work, and talk about the challenges they faced, how they overcame them, and what they got out of the project.Doors open at 7pm for a 7.30pm start - The event is FREE to attend but you will need to book a ticket from the link below as numbers are strictly limited. {{LINK 1}}Grab My FREE Ticket Now!   There is this urge to photograph the sublime, yet we find ourselves surrounded by the ordinary and overlooked. What stops us from photographing the mundane? Our perception of aesthetics and beauty, to which the ordinary often does not conform? Or the sheer lack of interest in the subject matter which we deem not worth photographing? ©Daniel Muckle Jones Edgelands or peri-urban areas are land in-between, forming transition zones but also boundaries. These fringelands fulfil vital functions to our society, but their appearance might not appeal to a traditional perception of beauty, and so they are rarely photographed.In this project work seventeen photographers explore edgelands in North Wales and share their experience of, and personal take on, these frontier lands.They aimed at reaching four goals:1) to photograph the overlooked on the fringes of urbanised areas,2) to photograph in the vicinity where we live and work, thereby keeping the carbon footprint for this photo project as low as possible,3) to make this project a unique and personal account of what we see, and how we visualise our response to the edgeland, and4) to guide and encourage photographers with different photographic backgrounds and skill levels to step out of their comfort zone, engage with each other and build a community, nurture a growth mindset and expand our personal boundaries. ©John Staten This work resulted in a self-published photobook, the online edition can be seen here:{{LINK 2}}https://issuu.com/royalphotographicsociety/docs/frontiers_north_walesWe are pleased to host this event in a follow up to the published book, to allow an insight to the photographers and their work.A full schedule of the evening's speakers will be released shortly. ©Robert Cain Frontiers/Edgelands is a collaboration between the Royal Photographic Society and the North Wales Photographic Association.  \n \n \n\n"

Documentary photography is a unique medium that communicates the human condition seen through a moment in time. Documentary Group Chair, Mark Phillips, said “This year’s competition aimed to be much more inclusive to expand its reach, thus increasing its relevance. With over 3500 images from across the world and an international panel of judges, I think we’ve achieved that.”While the Covid 19-Pandemic is seen as the paramount issue of the era, it is also important that other stories are told. The competition recognises and celebrates the work of photographers who have used a distinctive personal approach to documenting social, medical, political and environmental issues affecting communities and individuals.Judge Roy Mehta commented \" The first thing that struck me was the level of commitment displayed by each of the winning artists...  David Collyer offers us campaigning photojournalism from the front line of the NHS during the first wave of Covid.\"  ©DAVID COLLYER \"...Debsuddah Banerjee’s work, made in India, explores the psychological struggle of his elderly unmarried aunts, who lead a socially isolated life being discriminated due to their skin colour.\" ©DEBSUDDH BANERJEE For her work ‘Ka Dingiei’, Aishwarya Arumbakkan becomes the first winner of the Student Category, which was launched this year to  encourage the next generation of photographers. ©AISHWARYA ARUMBAKKAN The touring exhibition showing a selection of work from the winning entrants and runners-up can be seen here at Oriel Colwyn from Tuesday 14th June to Tuesday 12th July.As usual, the exhibition is free to view. OPENING EVENT SATURDAY 18th JUNE - (6pm-9.30pm) To compliment the exhibition and documentary photography work in general we will be holding two special events - one in the exhibition opening week and one in the closing week.We are pleased to now release details of the initial opening event - the event is FREE but with limited numbers - to ensure a place you will need grab a ticket from the link below to attend.  (More details on the closing event will be released shortly.) {{LINK 1}}Grab My FREE ticket NOWWhen all tickets have been allocated a 'waitlist' will automatically be activated - if/when places become available they will then be issued to people on this waitlist in order of sign-up. SATURDAY 18th JUNE  We are pleased to host an evening of exhibition viewing with a varied selection of both the winners and commended photographers speaking about their work.

From the very early days they mended nets, gutted fish and baited lines, but they also did all the domestic work and raised the children. They even carried their men out to the fishing boats on their backs to ensure that they could go to sea in dry clothing.Celebrated in the original calotype photographs of Hill & Adamson in Newhaven in the early 1840s and in the paintings of Winslow Homer, Isa & Robert Jobling, John McGhie and others from the 1880s to the 1920s, the fisherwomen of the British east coast were a common sight as they gutted and packed the herring into barrels on the bustling quaysides or carried the catch in baskets to sell door to door.Today fisherwomen are no longer calling their wares on the quayside but are to be found mostly behind closed doors, working unseen in large fish processing factories, smokehouses and small family firms all around the coast. They are still fiercely proud of what they do.  ©Craig Easton, Louise Hutchins, filleter, Aberdeen, 2013‘I’ve never had a job like it, it’s constant banter. It’s piecework and I was one of the fastest gutters – it took me a couple of months to learn it and a year to pick up speed. My hand used to cramp up and I used to stab my finger all the time.’  Louise Hutchins.  HERITAGE:  The herring lassies are a unique phenomenon in the history of British women at work. A band of female-only migratory workers, who from 1860 onward left their families behind to follow the Scottish herring fleets to gut and salt-pickle the catch. The work was tough, the salt ate into their fingers, and they labored long hours outdoors in uncovered, unpaved yards surrounded by fish guts, but as workers they were fiercely respected, and the women valued their independence.The tradition of ‘going to the herring’ was passed from mother to daughter for almost a hundred years and at its peak in 1913 as many as 6,000 herring girls would come to Shetland in early summer, staying in purpose-built gutters’ huts and working three to a crew: two gutters and one packer. The money was one thing, the camaraderie and freedom from parental control another with many older women remembering the time spent living in cheap lodgings and working long hours gutting and packing on the quayside as a ‘holiday’ despite the physical discomfort of bending down low over the farlan (the wooden trough the herring were tipped into) and the hazards of deep cuts from razor sharp knives. ©Craig Easton, Mary Williamson, gutter, Whalsay, Shetland, 2019‘At the end of the season, I set off from Lowestoft to London and I was there nearly three weeks. Oh dear, I fairly enjoyed that. I spent all my money. We’d had such a busy season; we were awfully well paid. I was at Simbister, one year, Lerwick two and then three and then four. And then I married. Silly me. I was twenty-two.’  Mary Williamson. ©Craig Easton: The hands that gut the herring I  JOURNEY:  From the early part of the nineteenth century right up to the middle of the twentieth century, the herring fishery was one of the most important industries in Scotland. Each year as the shoals swam south through the North Sea, the fishermen of the herring fleet followed them. The east coast men began their journey in Shetland in the early summer and for the next six months sailed south bringing their catch into the fishing towns and villages down the length of the North Sea coast of the British Isles. The annual pilgrimage ended in the early winter at the English seaside resorts of Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft.Whilst the fishermen travelled by sea, the fisherwomen mirrored their journey by land travelling from port-to-port gutting and packing the herring into barrels on the quaysides. The majority were Scots, but they were joined by women from the east coast of Ireland and a few from England, with special trains laid on to take the women south. Before the days of large factory ships with facilities to process the catch at sea, the connection between the fishing ports was tangible.‘All the boats used to moor up, tie up at the weekend because the Scots fishermen, they never fished on a Sunday. The Englishmen did, but never the Scots. They all went to church with a Bible under their arm and sang hymns. They got drunk on Saturday, then went to church on Sunday to have their sins forgiven and then Monday they were all out at sea again.’- Edna Donaldson. ©Craig Easton, Muckle Flugga, Shetland, 2018  {{LINK 1}}CRAIG EASTON is an international multi award-winning photographer whose work is deeply rooted in the documentary tradition.

Pecker (Edward Furlong) makes a living working behind a sandwich shop counter, but comes alive behind the lens of a camera. His snapshots of his odd family and friends are discovered by an art dealer, who decides they are masterpieces and determines to make Pecker the toast of the New York gallery set. But will his new-found fame alienate Pecker from his photographs' subjects, and, in particular, Shelly (Christina Ricci), the woman he loves?A gritty view of life as an emerging artist and a sneak peek into the pitfalls of making it big in the Manhattan art world. Pecker grapples with the very dilemmas that beset anyone aspiring to turn their love for photography into a profession or accept its siren call as a vocation. Y CLWB FFILM FFOTOMae’n bleser gennym gyhoeddi menter newydd, CLWB FFILM PHOTO a fydd yn dangos am y tro cyntaf erioed ffilm neu raglen ddogfen yn seiliedig ar ffotograffiaeth tua bob 6 wythnos yn sinema hyfryd Theatr Colwyn.Cyfle i wylio ffilm am ffotograffiaeth, cyfarfod hen ffrindiau a gwneud ffrindiau newydd ac yna mynd am ddiod neu bryd o fwyd rhywle yn y dre i gymdeithasu ychydig.Byddwn yn ceisio cadw prisiau tocynnau mor isel â phosibl fel eu bod yn fwy hygyrch.

The open cast mine closed in late 2021 whilst the coal washery currently remains open, it closes imminently in early 2022, ending a long history of coal mining in the area.During the 1984/85 miners’ strike, lesbians and gays formed a group called Lesbians and Gays Support the Miners'. They travelled from London and visited the Dulais Valley, generously donating money to striking miners and their families. The story is dramatized in the film 'Pride'. The bond between LGSM and the local community remains strong to this day and regular visits are made to the upper Dulais Valley. Roger TileyRoger Tiley (Rog), was born in 1960, growing up in a small mining community in the South Wales Valleys. Indeed, many of his relatives were coal miners.Whilst studying A-levels at the local sixth form college, Roger was invited to join a new A level photography course, asthe lecturer was desperately short of student numbers and Roger was facing being expelled from college. It was life changing andafter completing his A levels, he began an apprenticeship as an industrial photographer for a large international car components manufacturer.It proved to be a valuable grounding, but his love was for documentary photography and in 1982, Roger gained a place on the prestigious Documentary Photography course, under the leadership of Magnum photographer, David Hurn.On completion, Roger began to work for national and international newspapers and magazines. His work gained international recognition, especially his work in coal mining areasduring the 1984/85 miners' strike.This early work led to commissions in the USA and the UK, regularly exhibiting in numerous group and solo exhibitions.Roger has presented lectures in both the UK and USA and has also worked as a lecturer in lens based media. But his philosophy has always been 'practice what you preach'. \"Manyin academia talk a good talk and not practice what they preach!\"In more recent years, Roger has worked on moving image assignments, recently directing the full length cinematic documentary, titled 'Pride in our Valley'.Hobbies include playing rugby at the tender age of 60, fitness training and dancing 🙂 Y CLWB FFILM FFOTORoedd hi mor braf gweld cymaint ohonoch chi yng Ngŵyl Ffotograffiaeth ‘The Northern Eye’ Oriel Colwyn ym mis Hydref.  Rydym wedi eich colli chi a’r holl ryngweithio ac ymgysylltiad â ffotograffiaeth y gall digwyddiadau fel hyn eu cynnig.Gyda hyn mewn golwg, mae ein Curadur wedi bod yn edrych ar ffyrdd o redeg digwyddiadau ffotograffiaeth mwy rheolaidd er mwyn annog cyfarfod yn ddiogel am drafodaeth, ymgysylltiad a mwynhad.Rydym ni felly’n hapus iawn i gyhoeddi menter newydd, CLWB FFILM FFOTO a fydd yn dangos ffilm neu raglen ddogfennol seiliedig ar ffotograffiaeth bob ryw 4-6 wythnos ar brynhawn dydd Sadwrn yn sinema Theatr Colwyn wych.Cyfle i wylio ffilm am ffotograffiaeth, cyfarfod hen ffrindiau a gwneud ffrindiau newydd ac yna mynd am ddiod neu bryd bach o fwyd rywle yn y dref i gymdeithasu ychydig.Byddwn yn ceisio cadw prisiau'r tocynnau mor isel ag y gallwn fel eu bod yn agored i fwy o bobl.

For the first time, McCullin speaks candidly about his three-decade career and the photographs that often defined historic moments.Celebrated photographer Don McCullin worked for The Sunday Times from 1966 to 1983, at a time when the newspaper was widely recognised as being at the cutting edge of international investigative photojournalism. During that period he covered wars and humanitarian disasters on virtually every continent: from civil war in Cyprus, the war in Vietnam and the man-made famine in Biafra to the plight of the homeless in swinging sixties London.Jacqui and David Morris' BAFTA nominated documentary uses rich, detailed archive footage and incredible in-depth interviews to reveal the truth behind McCullin's hard-hitting and controversial images, piecing together his remarkable story in truly breathtaking style. Exploring not only McCullin's life and work, but how the ethos of journalism has changed throughout his career, the film is a commentary on the history of photojournalism told through the lens of one of its most acclaimed photographers. One not to be missed!Y CLWB FFILM FFOTORoedd hi mor braf gweld cymaint ohonoch chi yng Ngŵyl Ffotograffiaeth ‘The Northern Eye’ Oriel Colwyn ym mis Hydref.  Rydym wedi eich colli chi a’r holl ryngweithio ac ymgysylltiad â ffotograffiaeth y gall digwyddiadau fel hyn eu cynnig.Gyda hyn mewn golwg, mae ein Curadur wedi bod yn edrych ar ffyrdd o redeg digwyddiadau ffotograffiaeth mwy rheolaidd er mwyn annog cyfarfod yn ddiogel am drafodaeth, ymgysylltiad a mwynhad.Rydym ni felly’n hapus iawn i gyhoeddi menter newydd, CLWB FFILM FFOTO a fydd yn dangos ffilm neu raglen ddogfennol seiliedig ar ffotograffiaeth bob ryw 6 wythnos ar brynhawn dydd Sadwrn yn sinema Theatr Colwyn wych.Cyfle i wylio ffilm am ffotograffiaeth, cyfarfod hen ffrindiau a gwneud ffrindiau newydd ac yna mynd am ddiod neu bryd bach o fwyd rywle yn y dref i gymdeithasu ychydig.Byddwn yn ceisio cadw prisiau'r tocynnau mor isel ag y gallwn fel eu bod yn agored i fwy o bobl.

Capturing the different workers of society, his photographs transform workplaces into stages and his subjects into actors. ©B.Griffin Complimenting Brian’s recent talk at The Northern Eye Festival, this exhibition presents an autobiographical survey of the work that shares what it was like to survive as a photographer at the start of his career. In the exhibition we see the artist tell the story through his personal experience of those tough times.‘Those were analogue days! Growing up amongst the factories of the Black Country, studying photography in Manchester alongside my friends Daniel Meadows and Martin Parr, and then with trepidation going down to London to make a living as a photographer in the early 1970’s. In popular recollection, the 1970’s have gone down as the dark ages; Britain’s gloomiest period since the second world war, was set between Harold Wilson’s ‘swinging sixties ’and Margaret Thatcher’s divisive eighties. What was it like to be a young photographer then? By the end of the 1980’s my photography was known throughout the world. How did I do it? What did I go through? It’s all in this exhibition and my recent publication in which I tell the story, warts and all.’Brian Griffin 2021.Born in Birmingham, Griffin began a career in engineering aged 16, before enrolling to study photography at Manchester Polytechnic at 21. His first solo show was mounted in London in 1981, followed by solo shows in Europe, Asia and the USA. Griffin has published twenty books and in 1991, he was awarded the ‘Best Photography Book in the World’ prize at Barcelona Primavera Fotografica. ©B.GriffinBrian worked with a huge variety of music industry clients including Depeche Mode, REM, Elvis Costello, Iggy Pop, Ringo Starr, Peter Gabriel and Brian May; and his work can be seen on many album covers from the era.He is famous for his ground-breaking approach to portraiture from Iggy Pop to Kate Bush, and numerous high profile projects stretching from 'Work' in the 1980's to his project charting 'The Road to 2012', commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery. 'Work' went on to be awarded the Best Photography book in the World at the Barcelona Primavera Fotografica 1991 and The Life magazine used the photograph \"A Broken Frame\" on its front cover of a special supplement \"The Greatest Photographs Of The 80's\". ©B.Griffin Brian Griffin’s photographs are held in the permanent collections of major art institutions including the Arts Council, British Council, Victoria & Albert Museum and National Portrait Gallery, London.As always, our exhibitions are free to visit.{{LINK 2}}www.briangriffin.co.uk \n \n \n\n"

After the regime fell from power in 2001, a fledgling free press emerged and a photography revolution was born. Now, as foreign troops and media withdraw, Afghanistan is left to stand on its own, and so are its journalists. Set in a modern Afghanistan bursting with color and character, FRAME BY FRAME follows four Afghan photojournalists as they navigate an emerging and dangerous media landscape  – reframing Afghanistan for the world, and for themselves. Through cinema vérité, intimate interviews, powerful photojournalism, and never-before-seen archival footage shot in secret during the Taliban regime, the film connects audiences with four humans in the pursuit of the truth. {{LINK 1}}BOOK TICKETS \"A piercing, poignant and — as befits its subject — beautifully composed exploration of the challenges and responsibilities faced by photojournalists in Afghanistan’s post-Taliban free press.\" {{LINK 2}} – Variety\"Follow four photojournalists focused on the future...\" {{LINK 3}}– Los Angeles Times \"A sharp, soulful doc...

We are pleased to be able to now open Oriel Colwyn around the varying days it is operating.{{LINK 1}}BOOK YOUR FREE TIMED VISIT HERE Pier Closing Time showcases Michael Bennett’s 1979 photographic journey through North Wales. Mournful of a lost world, always ironic, this is a bitter-sweet portrait of seaside resorts in and out of season. Llandudno ©Michael Bennett 1979 In 1979, The Mostyn Gallery, Llandudno was due to re-open after decades of closure. Its recently-appointed director Hugh Adams commissioned a photographic project from photographer Michael Bennett, with the intention of capturing the atmosphere of North Wales coastal resorts in winter.With a working title of Anatomy of Melancholy, an exhibition was scheduled soon after the gallery’s refurbishment and re-opening.Things didn’t quite go to plan. Soon after photography began, Hugh Adams resigned, to be replaced by (unrelated) Clive Adams.When Michael delivered the project, he was surprised to find the gallery responded negatively to the images. Penmaenmawr ©Michael Bennett 1979 \"The gallery commissioner almost certainly expected a romanticised impression of the coast,\" he says. \"To me, this wouldn't have been honest - I felt I needed to show exactly how it was.\"The new artistic director’s solution was to commission a return to the same places in summer, in the hope that the show would be more upbeat.Summer in the resorts brought more people but no fundamental change in character.Fearful that the finished exhibition would be a catastrophe, Adams asked amateur photographers to exhibit their own work alongside Bennett’s, to counter its perceived pessimism. Renamed The Road to Barmouth, the exhibition opened in 1980. Following hostile local newspaper reviews, on closure it was dismantled and then forgotten for nearly 40 years. Rhyl ©Michael Bennett 1979 RESTORED AND PUBLISHED IN FULL FOR THE FIRST TIMEThe project would have stayed out of sight forever had it not been for Val Williams and Karen Shepherdson, curators of Seaside Photographed, an exhibition first seen at the Turner Contemporary Museum, Margate in 2019. Following a public call for submissions, Bennett sent images from the North Wales project. Llandudno Library ©Michael Bennett 1979 Ten pictures were selected and shown as part of the first photographic show staged by The Turner Contemporary, and were included in the accompanying Thames & Hudson book, alongside works by Jane Bown, Martin Parr and Henri Cartier-Bresson.The original film negatives were digitised, restored and re-mastered for this book.Following renewed interest, in late 2020 the project was published in a dedicated book for the first time. Many images had never been seen before. The first signed limited edition sold out nearly instantly. A second signed edition was available from 20th January 2020. The book is now in its 5th print run and can be purchased from Cow On The Roof Press {{LINK 2}}HERE Llandudno Pier (closing time) ©Michael Bennett 1979 ABOUT THE PHOTOGRAPHERSelf-taught in photography, in 1976 Bennett created an intimate project documenting his own family, first seen at the Impressions Gallery of Photography, York. The Family toured England, was seen at the Institute of Contemporary Art, London, and later made into a BBC Arena film.The Victoria & Albert Museum and the Arts Council of Great Britain acquired work from The Family for their permanent collections.He has worked for The Times, The Independent, The Sunday Times, The BBC, The Financial Times, BBC World Service, New Society, and The New Statesman, and had a long association with the satirical magazine Private Eye.A number of Bennett’s portraits of prominent British people commissioned by The Independent are in the {{LINK 3}}National Portrait Gallery, London.London’s Victoria & Albert Museum acquired the complete Family project, adding to the V&A’s collection of Bennett’s work, which includes other pictures {{LINK 4}}(Platelayer on Holyhead main line, 1979) from the Welsh project seen in Pier Closing Time.  We’ve put changes in place so that you can enjoy a safe visit.

Shrouded in secrecy, the activities at the grove have become the subject of countless conspiracy theories and rumours.\nIn Jack Latham’s Parliament of Owls, he investigates the secrecy of the club and the wider political effects this has caused.\n \n\n \nWhat happens when the country’s top lawmakers, politicians, artists, lawyers, and businessmen meet behind closed doors? What secrets are being swapped, plans being made? For years these questions have been at the root of protest groups and journalists hoping to expose the truth.\nLatham takes the viewer on a journey of discovery, showcasing the town surrounding Bohemian Grove (the club’s rural outpost) and its people.\n \nMain Stage at Mitchell Brothers O'Farrell Theatre, San Francisco ©Jack Latham\n \nHis photographs also depict the rise of Alex Jones—conspiracy theorist and founder of InfoWars—and how his break-in at the Grove in 2000 led him to become a household name with the antiestablishment crowd.\nIn an attempt to ‘expose the new world order’, Jones released alarmist footage of the club’s “Cremation of Care”, a theatrical ceremony in which an effigy of the members’ 'worldly cares' is burnt.\n \nPhantom Patriot, Nevada, 2018 @Jack Latham.Phantom Patriot was the name taken by Richard McCaslin of Carson City, Nevada, who, on January 19, 2002, attempted an attack on the Bohemian Grove after viewing Alex Jones’ documentary. He was imprisoned in California for 8 years. He now resides in Nevada and has a super hero base in his backyard which he refers to as the ‘Protectorate Outpost’\n \nBeyond inspiring a bizarre attack on Bohemian Grove by a masked vigilante calling himself the Phantom Patriot in 2002, the release of the video footage, set within an alarmist context, was instrumental in increasing Jones’ profile as a far-right activist and subsequently spring-boarded infowars to become an influential outlet of fake news in recent US politics.\nIn 'Parliament of Owls', Jack Latham investigates the effects that a vacuum of information can cause.\nThe series gives only glimpses into Bohemian Grove, itself fuelling its mystery. Shot entirely in black and white, the series offers a view into the club’s winding path, or a photograph taken from the perspective of somebody hiding in the trees. The images are mysterious; they offer no answers of their own, and are therefore a vacuum of context themselves.\n \n \nMonte Rio Cinema ©Jack Latham\n \nJack Latham (born in Cardiff, 1989) is a Welsh photographer based in the United Kingdom. His work primarily focuses on aspects of storytelling throughout society. Past works including A Pink Flamingo (2015) and Sugar Paper Theories (2016) have featured in a number of solo shows which including, Reykjavik Museum of Photography, TJ Boulting Gallery and the Royal Photographic Society. Latham’s projects have also gone on to win multiple awards including the Bar-Tur Photobook award (2015), Image Vevey - Heidi.News Prize (2019).\nParliament of Owls was winner of the BJP International Photography Award in 2019.\n{{LINK 3}}www.jacklatham.com \n \n\nCymraeg\nRoedd disgwyl i arddangosfa 'Parliament of Owls' gan Jack Latham i agor yn union cyn y cyfnod clo ar draws y DU ym mis Mawrth.

    "body": "\n\n18% Collective – Original Copy\n \n\n27th February - 21st March 2020 \n FdA Photography Exhibition 2020 - Llandrillo CollegeAt the start of each year, Oriel Colwyn takes the opportunity to support and showcase the group exhibition from 2nd year students completing Llandrillo College's FDA Photography course.This year we introduce you to work by: Sarah WilliamsMy interest is in portraiture and the work I produce is very much influenced by the visual language of horror movies and other associated genres. Using an established format for representing fear and trauma where women are mostly depicted as victims is for me a way of challenging the accepted state of affairs. Untitled © Sarah Williams Katie ValintineMy work for this exhibition centres on issues associated with the clothing industry. The state of the earth and saving it is paramount for many people and to draw attention to areas of concern through my own photography has to be a worthwhile endeavour. Untitled © Katie Valintine Harley  DaviesThe gradual change in town culture from supplying goods to entertainment has impacted hugely on the social landscape of Britain. Where there were once shops and sole traders, we now find clubs, bars and cafes. During the daytime, the dying towns are inhabited by those who can’t afford the out of town experience. They buy the goods from the bargain basement stores and sit with friends outside Costa’s drinking coffee on cold, damp British days. The younger generation emerge in the evening to populate the bars and seek out the night. This is me and Colwyn Bay is my town. I usually go to Noahs, a newly refurbished bar in the centre of Colwyn Bay. This is where I hang out with friends, play pool, listen to music and photograph the nights. Friday is especially good, with the dance floor illuminated and that party in full swing, I go after the pictures. Kalen LindellCar culture is a global obsession and for the last two years I have been documenting the British scene, travelling the length and breadth of the country, both night and day, to go to as many car related events as I can. Hanging out in car parks on cold and frosty nights to celebrate the latest conversions and mods carried out by enthusiasts like me, talking engines, upgrades, handling and traction, all harks back to those early days. On weekends you will usually find me at an organised track event, camera at the ready, photographing the action and the behind the scenes urgencies and camaraderie. Denise BakerIn the wake of the Brexit referendum, I attended demonstrations, not as a passive observer, but as an active participant. As an activist I have spent my life standing up for people’s rights and making my voice heard. Now in the age of the internet and social networking I use my camera as well as my voice, not to create editorial content, but to document and share stories unfolding on the street. I also became fascinated with the messages; British protests say a lot about the British temperament, the banners and placards display a ‘politeness’; a low-key understated style of humour that seems quite specific to Britain. Untitled © Denise Baker Callum HumphreysMONAAfter falling into the all too familiar small-town trap of destructive lifestyle choices, I made a conscious decision in my mid-twenties to break unhealthy patterns. As a result, I became much more introverted, yet content, with a new form of clarity. Suddenly, I realised I knew nothing of the quiet, rural island that had shaped me.The aim of the project was to reconnect with a place I call home, and to decode the conditioning that once propelled me to leave it behind. Untitled © Callum Humphreys Jade VickersThe book exhibited here is what publishers would call a dummy. It’s the first attempt at laying the work out in some kind of visual order. I’m trying to tell a story of my life in a visually intricate way. The images are not in any specific chronological order but are set to the pages in a way that resembles my own idea of memory. The juxtapositions offer new possibilities of layers and connections, and in years to come, I wonder if these images will become the only concrete evidence for those memories at all? Will I truly know what I did just before or after the picture was taken. If I had not taken the picture, would I remember the moment all? Untitled © Jade Vickers Abby Georgia AntonHaving been brought up on the North Coast of Wales, slate quarrying was something I associated with the mountains of Snowdonia and was something that belonged to our history. The old quarrying sites and the mountains of slate waste that I had seen on car journeys were just a part of the backdrop of North Wales. Little did I know that this was an industry that had once helped shape the industrial world and impacted on the culture of North Wales as significantly as the coal valleys of the South.  Untitled © Abby Georgia Anton Bob Mcraight Text to follow... Featherlight © Bob Mcraight  \n \n \n\n"

Please order your (free) ticket(s) from this {{LINK 1}}LINK An exhibition by Hazel Simcox, Roj Smith, Ethan Beswick, Philip Jones and Robert Law.Five photographers share their personal observations and stories concerned with North Wales. In a response to an area rightly known for its wonderful landscapes, the North Wales Project’s aim is to bring photographers together who document and give a voice to the overlooked or intriguing, and collectively offer an honest portrait of this special region and its people. Hazel Simcox’s ‘Space_My_’ is a personal tribute to the first woman mountain guide and writer, Gwen Moffat. Hazel revisits locations in Gwen’s autobiography, photographs them and reflects on parts of Gwen’s writing that resonate deeply with her personal experience. The result is a collection of sensitive and meaningful observations, cleverly combined with text from the book. © Hazel Simcox  Roj Smith offers a melancholic glimpse of the well known, normally busting coastal towns of Llandudno and Conwy at night after the crowds have gone. Familiar places take on a different character as we see Roj’s talent for observing the modelling effect of artificial light on urban scenes, juxtaposed with empty spaces. © Roj Smith  In his own words, Ethan Beswick “Has been photographing throughout North Wales, compiling a melodious, if ambiguous, response to the Welsh Landscape. His series ‘The Fruit Bar Line’ is a contemplation on Wales, on the people who inhabit it, and on the mechanics of belonging, inadequacy, and desire.” © Ethan Beswick  Philip Jones works casually, walking streets, industrial areas and countryside. He explores the peripheries of towns, cities and villages. \"I often go to the same places over and over and if I visit somewhere new, I will begin the process of returning many times until I know the place well, compulsively taking pictures with no sense of reliance on other images or subject, I tend to \"saw off the branch I’m sitting on'. The photographs seem to belong to an infinite cycle of walking, looking, believing and then re-visiting\" © Philip Jones  Robert Law presents his project ‘Holyhead – Sea Change?/Caergybi – Troad Llanw?’ Holyhead is a fiercely independently-minded town with a proud, close community and rich heritage, but overlooked and underinvested over the years and facing increasing economic challenges. Robert takes an intimate look at a town facing Brexit and an uncertain future. © Robert Law The exhibition opens on Saturday 11th January with a specially combined Pechakucha Night in the gallery, where we will be inviting upto 8 people to present their photographic work specifically being made in or about North Wales.

It is also connected to the Afan Valley via the A4107, which leads through to the coastline and industrial town of Port Talbot. The Bwlch road itself is the A4061, which stretches approximately 25 miles. Gap in the Hedge - ©Dan Wood Not only did the pass offer a lifeline to the isolated valleys, and present greater job opportunities for the local people but it also provided an essential shortcut for valley based industry; predominantly coal related. Dan’s parents used the pass themselves to make their own move to Bridgend in 1966; starting their own business there shortly after.“Loosely based around nostalgia, ‘Gap in the Hedge’ reflects on a journey I used to make with my Mother to visit relatives in the Rhondda Valley, every Saturday when I was a small boy. It was my first taste of a road trip and I can recall almost every inch of the journey. I’d sit there in the front seat of my Mother’s little red car utterly absorbed and mesmerised by the forests, terraced houses and falling rock warning signs. The journey seemed to take forever, but we were only ever around 30 minutes from home.”This series not only attempts to document the beauty of this iconic piece of South Wales landscape, but also explores the relationship that the people - whether locals, tourists or workers - have with the landscape and environment. And ultimately, what lies ahead for this part of South Wales following Brexit and the abolition of EU funding. Gap in the Hedge - ©Dan Wood The immediate villages of Nantymoel and Cwmparc - both of which are former mining communities - either side of the mountain, are incorporated into the project, as the pair both sit in the shadow of ‘The Bwlch’. Gap in the Hedge - ©Dan Wood Gap in the Hedge was first shown in Colwyn Bay as a part of this year'sNorthern Eye Festival, we are pleased to be able to continue to showcase this beautiful work in our main gallery space until the end of December.Dan WoodBorn in Wales, UK, 1974, Dan is a self taught documentary and portrait photographer, who discovered photography in the early 90's through his love of the skateboard culture.His work has been featured in many publications including The British Journal of Photography, CCQ Magazine, Ernest Journal and Jungle Magazine. Dan has participated in over 45 exhibitions both nationally and internationally; including 6 solo shows and in 2018 he was announced as one of the winners of the BJP, Portrait of Britain prize.Several pieces of work are held in the permanent collections at the {{LINK 1}}MMX Gallery, London and {{LINK 2}}Film's Not Dead Print Room, London. His ‘Suicide Machine’ and ‘Gap in the Hedge’ books & prints are held in the collection at the {{LINK 3}}Martin Parr Foundation, Bristol.{{LINK 4}}www.danwoodphoto.com \n \n \n\n"

Whether it is Barry Island or Benidorm, for the ordinary folks of Wales there is a compelling desire to have a great day out and, a night on the tiles is a powerful incentive to help one cope with the drudgery of every day life. A day out (or 6 or 7) at the seaside with your family is a welcome escape. Doing it with your mates and a chance to dress up is an added bonus. Dayz Out in Porthcawl - ©Ron McCormick Ron McCormick has been photographing the British seaside off and on for nearly fifty years and first exhibited some of that work in 1973 in a two-man show (with Josef Koudelka) about the Essex seaside resort of Southend on Sea. Dayz Out in Porthcawl - ©Ron McCormick This current Work in Progress mini show returns to the theme with a selection of pictures made in Porthcawl over the last three years and takes in “girls nights out”, “the cult of Elvis” and “a family day at the seaside” overlaid with a whiff of hedonistic celebration that mirrors the extravagant indulgence of Blackpool, Brighton and Bognor. Dayz Out in Porthcawl - Ron McCormick Dayz Out in Porthcawl was originally shown as part of The Northern Eye Festival and with the kind agreement of Ron, remains in place at the entrance to Oriel Colwyn until the end of December.Ron McCormickMcCormick is widely known for his social documentary photography of Whitechapel in the 1970's and for his critical approach to the urban landscape as seen in his work The Wasteland. Currently he has a major solo exhibition about the the changing landscape of the South Wales Valleys following the decline of Coal and Steel; HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY is at the Newport Museum & Art Gallery until March 14th 2020.Ron McCormick trained as an artist at Liverpool School of Art and the Royal Academy Schools in London before moving across to photography. He played a significant role in the formation and development of photography galleries across the UK in the 1970’s - including Half Moon Gallery in London, Side Gallery in Newcastle upon Tyne and the original Ffotogallery in Cardiff.Ron taught on the Newport Documentary Photography course alongside David Hurn and established ‘The Newport Survey’ publication that students worked on as part of their studies - produced over a decade in the 1980’s . He was one of the first photographers to be commissioned by Ffotogallery to produce work for the highly regarded ‘Valleys Project’ in the 1980’s and his documentary work of the changing landscape and communities in the south Wales valleys as coal mining disappeared in the region is considered to be some of the best produced.{{LINK 1}}HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY at Newport Museum & Art Gallery  \n \n \n\n"

    "body": "\n\nInside the Outside – Out of the woods of thought\n \n\n26th July - 14th September 2019 \nInside the Outside is a collective of contemporary photographers founded in a Chelsea pub in 2016 by Al Brydon, Rob Hudson, Stephen Segasby and Joseph Wright.Their philosophy hinges on a number of interconnected questions about how they relate to the landscape and the way in which this informs their representation in photographic form.Being in the landscape and representing the landscape is to simultaneously inhabit two worlds, the one before us and the one inside us. And when those two worlds collide and overlap the result can often surprise.They took inspiration for their name, Inside the Outside from John Muir’s words ‘I only went out for a walk and finally concluded to stay out till sundown, for going out, I found, was really going in.’.They are a diverse group of photographers who share an awareness of that transformative potential and for whom it has become an essential element of their work. It is a question they commonly explore in highly individual and personal representations of the land around them.Their images are not merely representations of the landscape. Each of the exhibitors has a story to tell, a personal engagement with a place which is beyond the literal document. Perhaps, as {{LINK 1}}Minor White suggests, all these photographs are ‘self portraits’.In contrast to the traditional norms of landscape photography, we aren’t simply invited to imagine ourselves in the place we’re witnessing, but asked to step into the shoes of the photographers, or the protagonists whose stories are recounted. To imagine the stories these places tell us, to engage on a level beyond the insufficiencies of merely looking.These are not necessarily places of classical beauty, but places that tell us something about what it is to be human. They tell our story by telling us the stories of the people or events that formed and shaped the places we inhabit today.These are sometimes contested places. The landscape is riven with conflict, sometimes literally war in the case of Rob Hudson’s Mametz Wood. More so there are conflicting issues of ownership versus access, commercial exploitation versus ecological diversity, and perhaps most pertinently in the current political climate, landscapes are contested in the political sphere by issues of borders vs. the freedom to travel or migrate. Mametz Wood ©Rob Hudson Mametz Wood ©Rob Hudson The ability to imagine (or re-imagine) these stories is central to the work of Inside the Outside Joseph Wright’s The Floods which takes an easily ignored ‘scruffy edgeland’, the antithesis of the idealist pastoral English landscape, only to reveal the magic within.  The Floods ©Joseph Wright The Floods ©Joseph Wright Stephen Segasby’s Malevolence finds the menace in the dark woods of the Forest of Dean. ©Stephen Segasby ©Stephen Segasby And Al Brydon’s Solargraphs reveal the element of the landscape that we all take for granted - time itself. The exposures in this work are so long they become a reflection upon our lives and our short tenure on this world. Solargraphs ©Al Brydon Solargraphs ©Al Brydon\"Finding new ways to engage and to express that engagement with the landscape is key. For if we’re to get out of the woods of the multiple threats of climate change, collapsing biodiversity and the loss of knowledge about, and appreciation of the land we need to remind as wide a possible sphere of people of why the land is precious to them. The simple depiction of the landscape as a beautiful untarnished place empty of people, their stories and their histories does not tell a whole truth. We illustrate the land by telling the stories that illuminate us.\"Rob Hudson    {{LINK 2}}www.inside-the-outside.com {{LINK 3}}www.robhudsonlandscape.net {{LINK 4}}www.josephwright.co.uk{{LINK 5}}www.stephensegasby.com{{LINK 6}}www.al-brydon.com  \n \n \n\n"

Joined by brother David and supported by a passionate team of film makers and photographers, they crafted a nostalgic feature film of startling beauty, recording the passing of the old Victorian industry..Made over a period of 20 years, Gandolfi - Family Business tells the story of Fred and Arthur Gandolfi as they move from being the world's oldest living camera-makers into a well-earned retirement.Fred and Arthur Gandolfi lived & worked in their Peckham workshops from Edwardian times into the approaching digital age, and were by the 1980’s regarded alongside Fred Dibner as representations of living industrial archaeology. The Griffiths film lovingly captures the beauty of their craft, the legacy of their family, and the last years of their remarkable lives.Since its eventual premiere in 2004, when it won the Sheffield International Documentary competition the film has had only a select few screenings.Gandolfi-Family Business;(2003) Dir.

From hill farmers near her home in North Yorkshire to Icelandic puffin hunters, from Finnish ice swimmers to Romanian nomadic shepherds her projects reveal the fascinating intricacies of the dependencies between people, work and the land.Her series FarmerFlorist explores a new movement in the U.K. for ‘fair trade in flowers’ and celebrates the domestic flower growers of Britain, both past and present. In a series of stunning photographs, Tessa sheds light on the individuals who are contributing to this vibrant, artisan cut-flower industry.“Flowers always make people better, happier, and more helpful; they are sunshine, food and medicine to the mind”  Luther Burbank Flower farms were once a familiar feature of the British countryside, but were gradually expunged by industrialised growing methods in the 19th century and then globalisation in the 20th. But now in the 21st century, small flower farms are springing up again, fed by fresh interest in environmental sustainability and local seasonal produce. Ammi magus, Binnington Blooms, North Yorkshire from the series FarmerFlorist ©Tessa Bunney We are a nation of farmers, of gardeners, of flower lovers and our cut flower industry is worth 2.2 billion pounds a year. Flower farms were once a familiar feature of the British countryside and market gardeners grew flowers among their vegetables. In the 1800s, larger farms sprang up as transport links improved and daily trains carried violets from Dawlish, snowdrops from Lincolnshire and narcissi from Cornwall. Flower production has always necessarily been linked to transport, and with planes came distance. Now we can have any flower at any time of year, flown in from the equator, or hothoused in vast Dutch greenhouses.Recently a number of smaller British flower farms have sprung up, fuelled in part by the wider, resurgent interest in locally produced, seasonal, sustainably grown produce. They are contributing to a vibrant ‘artisan’ cut-flower industry in the UK.“We love flowers because they represent something that was taken from us. Growing them was what the British did until the 1980’s, but by embracing the global we lost the local. It’s no coincidence that just as we realise we’ve lost 90% of this country’s wild flower meadows, the flowers we’re asked for most are poppies, cornflowers and scabious.”  Caroline Beck, Flower Grower and Garden Writer Delphiniums, Naylor Flowers, Lincolnshire from the series FarmerFlorist ©Tessa Bunney Often popular with Eastern European workers, there is now a growing uncertainty amongst them as to their undecided future in the current on-going Brexit talks. Some have chosen to depart for other destinations leaving a shortage of workers in the flower farms. Hydroponically grown tulips, Smith and Munson, Lincolnshire from the series FarmerFlorist ©Tessa Bunney People say to me on a sunny day in June, ‘You have the ideal job.’ They never say that in November, when I’m planting bulbs and can’t feel my hands”.Gill Hodgson, Fieldhouse Flowers Tessa has been working in collaboration with members of non-profit organisation Flowers from the Farm. ({{LINK 1}}www.flowersfromthefarm.co.uk) FarmerFlorist exhibits at Oriel Colwyn to coincide with British Flowers Week  (10th – 16th June 2019)  {{LINK 2}}www.britishflowersweek.com/about   #BritishFlowersWeek   - Started by the Flower Market at New Covent Garden Market in 2013, British Flowers Week is an annual celebration of the wealth and variety of British cutflowers and foliage. Roses, Green and Gorgeous, Oxfordshire from the series FarmerFlorist ©Tessa Bunney Roses are probably my favourite of all flowers, I grow repeat-flowering scented roses. Scent is so important because that is what is missing when you buy roses in the shops. They’ve had the scent bred out of them so that they can be transported from the main rose-growing countries – Kenya, Ecuador, Colombia. Scent shortens vase life, so that’s why it has been bred out.

Woodfall’s stunning nature photography offers an in-depth understanding of an essential Rewilding movement and the people leading it.Spending over 22 years photographing nature, BBC Wildlife has described him as ‘the poet laureate of British and Irish landscapes'.He has won a number of international awards including category winners in the Wildlife Photographer of the Year Awards and in Natures Best (USA). Both his books, Natural Heartlands and Flowers at my Feet have been highly commended in the Natural History Book of the Year Awards. Rewilding has become the key talking point in the modern conservation movement. But it’s commonly misunderstood as a campaign to fill the forests with lynxes, wolves and bears, when in fact the ethos guiding the British rewilding movement is much more nuanced, and much broader in scope. It’s also much more complicated, requiring an in-depth understanding of the complexity of regional ecosystems. Atlantic White Sided Dolphins (Lagenorhychus acutus) ,two animals breaching the surface © David Woodfall  Huw Warren.Welsh pianist and composer Huw Warren has achieved an international reputation for innovative and eclectic music making over a thirty-year career.

He looks at the natural processes in nature like corrosion, erosion and layering and compares them to the same in printmaking. There are also some geological images from the Greek island of Crete.  Many of these geological formations found in North Wales and Crete are very similar and John is particularly interested in the fact that although similar, these are hundreds of millions of years younger than those of Ynys Môn. Pebble in Melange -Llanddwyn © John Hedley Fingertips in Time explores imagery for so long exclusive to the natural sciences. They are impressions that respect – even venerate – the visual mystery at the heart of this subject matter.The stress, layering and cracking in the printing process is analogous to processes in geology. The timeless quality of the flowing matter that created the rock seems to reside within the image. Aigos Galini © John Hedley Tree studies are also featured, these grow in response to light and environment and their form, like rocks, is created over many years. The organic abstraction and ambiguous patterns and layering found in the rock and tree formations are helping the work evolve. Coed Cadnant © John Hedley It is the multi-faceted possibilities in the different variations of layering and cracking within trees and rocks that manifest in the existence of nature that inspiring John's work. Process:Firstly, John makes an image in Photoshop from his photographs of trees or geological formations. These images are used to form a digital negative on acetate, John then exposes the images onto photopolymer plates using the Natgraph exposure unit at the {{LINK 1}}Regional Print Centre in Wrexham where he also develops them, ready for reworking into Intaglio printmaking. Lime Stone folds - Acetate for photec © John Hedley Most of these hand printed intaglio prints are one plate photopolymer (solar plate or photec) and 3 to 6 carborudum plates, which are then over printed using colour. Combining photographic digital with more tradition intaglio methods. They are then printed them onto damp paper on a press in his print studio, offset on to pieces of card and then turned into carborundum plates. John makes between 3 and 6 plates per image and uses two or three colours per plate.Carborundum grit is mixed with a varnish and then painted on to each plate depending on what colour or tone required. Ink is applied to the plates in the appropriate colours as well as the solar plate and finally they are printed on top of each other using a registration system.  It takes about an hour to print one image and each print is slightly different. Melange Llanddwyn - © John Hedley Based in North Wales, John has over many years, developed a deep and sustained interest in visual aspects of the natural sciences, especially geology and arboreal morphology. Since 2017 John has been funded by the Welsh Arts Council enabling a number of recent one-person exhibitions in public galleries in Wales, including {{LINK 2}}MOSTYN and the {{LINK 3}}Royal Cambrian Academy. 'Fingertips In Time' combines works from these past exhibitions and adds new elements and perspectives to take a fresh look at how photography has been used to inform and create these images.  \n \n \n\n"

Paul and Rachel were great teachers and I hope there will be more projects like this in years to come.”    - George\"I enjoyed the photography course as I loved going around all the different well-known and unknown places of Colwyn Bay and Conwy taking photos of everything we wanted. I also enjoyed using the dark room because it was something none of us had tried before and it was very interesting to try and work in the dark. This photography course helped me gain friends who you wouldn’t find in everyday life, but us as a group we created a strong bond between each of us and worked together as a team and helped each other along the way.\"    - DaisyConwy Railway Station - The station was opened May 1st 1848 and was closed as part of the Beeching cuts on Feb 13th 1966.

I have always had a somewhat clinical approach towards portraiture, I focus on the small details and I always create my images with the intent of being aestheticaly pleasing; it’s a style that works for me. I like my images to have a sense of realism whilst also creating a cinematic theme, I believe this combination allows the viewer to create their own story and context..\"© Andrew Haig Stewart CuttingMy photography has always been a creative escape. I have never been drawn to a single type of photography and as such my photos have always varied.

The documentary genre of German photographer August Sander and the American portrait photographer Diane Arbus influence a photographic style that captures the peculiarities of western culture. The images are executed with a humour and visual directness that draws the viewer into the appeal of this important visual icon which crosses boundaries of age and region. The Santa Claus photographs represent a family that illustrate the many characters of this fascinating individual. Here the brotherhood of Father Christmas is displayed as we are invited to make comparisons and form a personal judgement as regards our own favourite image that best represents our ‘ideal’ Santa.\"— Walter Waygood For the doubters of this image and for those who pose the question of scientific proof as regards his existence, the omnipresent nature of Santa is solved through the enlarged presence of his brothers who as a combined body form 'The Family of Santa Claus'. \"The most stunning shots of Father Christmas I have ever seen - Arbus like in their intensity.\"— Susan Beardmore, CREATIVE CAMERA 1982      \n \n \n\n"

Derby, London & New Work\n \n\n5th October - 17th November 2018 \n \"Trying to put together a group of images that represents a seamless back catalogue turns out to be a far more unwieldy process than I imagined. The idea of a cohesive message quickly flies out of the window and the task falls to another kind of selection. Original motivations slip away and the opportunity arises to look closely at the rhythm of similarities and to accept underlying interests. Most prominent is the photograph itself as an object in colour or tone. Accumulations of images around a particular subject or theme now appear as filtered repetitions of this primary fascination.\" Crow. 2012. - ©Tim Williams \"Place and identity are two things that interest me, and over time, the camera has helped me understand my own place in this world. The relationship between self and place is fundamental and not easy to untangle. As a teenager living in North Wales, I was desperate to experience an urban lifestyle, and when I eventually moved to London, I loved it, but I also felt like a fish out of water.  After a while, my default encoding kicked in and I started to walk. A move to Derby had been easier to comprehend — a manageable city with wonderful countryside on its doorstep. Derby also shares a secret known to all photographers who have lived there. Being at the centre of the British landmass, its light is unique and wonderful. Its quality is as palpable as the luminosity of the coast.\" Anest. 2014 - ©Tim Williams \"As a student in Derby in the late 1980s, I was introduced to a lineage of photography education that directly connected to the crucible to the late 1960’s, when people like Bill Jay, Sue Davies, Val Williams, Peter Turner, Tony Ray-Jones and others, shook things up by presenting exciting new work and offering a context that was set against a re-appraisal of the history of British photography. Two decades later, the photographic community that I was trying to join still appeared to be operating in a vacuum. There were a few UK galleries that were fighting the cause and a couple of arts council funding hot spots, where photographers flocked for opportunity. Books were an important consequence.\"\"By the turn of the new millennium, the murmur of digital photography was turning the traditional model upside down. New possibilities of endless exposures and screen viewing would make film and darkrooms a thing of the past, or so we were told. This was a decisive moment for the old guard — to abandon the safety of material and craft and to get on board with sensors and pixels. This period also saw the wholehearted embracing of photography by the serious art world. Print sales fetched record money and galleries were quick to capitalise on profitability, with bigger prints in ever decreasing limited editions.\"\"We are all now able to make pictures with ease and share them instantly, but the photograph’s relationship to the real is both as elusive and illusive as ever.  As someone great once said, “Photography was born whole.” In repeating the experiment over and over, I have gained a fondness for the pictures that demonstrate this peculiarity - where the camera reveals itself as a magical companion.\" \n \n \n\n"

This opened the door on a new and distant world for the scattered communities as the area was only served by the single width B4391 until the A4212 road opened in the early 1960s. The 25-mile route took 10 years to construct and consisted of 16 stops which were a combination of stations and halts. At the summit of the line, the main feature was the spectacular nine-arch Cwm Prysor viaduct, located at 1278 feet (390 metres) above sea level. Eradication 52.932437, -3.819561   ©Jamie George Stevens In 1955, plans were submitted by the Corporation of Liverpool to construct a reservoir in the valley above Bala to supply water to the growing population of Liverpool. The city had some of the worst slums in Britain post-war and they argued for more water for improved sanitation. This wasn’t the first time they had turned to Wales for water as eighty years earlier they drowned the village of Llanwddyn to create the Lake Vyrnwy Reservoir only 18 miles away. Residents were shocked by the news that their valley where the Welsh language was dominant may be drowned.By obtaining authority through an Act of Parliament in 1957, Liverpool City Council avoided having to gain consent from the Welsh planning authorities, and in 1965 after hard campaigning and attempts to stop the construction with several sabotages, the Tryweryn valley was flooded. The village post office, school, chapel and cemetery, were all lost. Twelve houses and farms were also submerged, and 48 people of the 67 who lived in the valley lost their homes. This also led to over a mile of the railway line being flooded along with parts of the B4391. Eradication 52.956765, -3.715992   ©Jamie George Stevens Although the powers granted under the act allowed for a diversion of the line, the British Transport Commission decided that the level of traffic would not justify the expenditure of £1,000,000 that re-routing of the line would entail. To allow the new works to proceed, passenger services ceased in January 1960 with the freight following a year later. Local people fought hard to save the line as it was regarded as the only means of transport for the local community. Even to this day, there is resentment to the flooding of the valley and the eradication of the village which was one of the last monoglot Welsh speaking communities.It is known as one of the most controversial construction projects in modern Welsh history. Eradication 52.929066, -3.798412   ©Jamie George Stevens 'Eradication' documents part of the disused line where it was at its most remote, through photographing the track bed which has been reclaimed by nature since its closure, and also by highlighting the environment and evidence of current usage of the land. The photographs appear in sequence from Bryncelynog halt, heading east through several halts and stations towards the former location of Tyddyn Bridge halt around nine and a half miles further. \n\nJamie George StevensJamie is based in Llanrug, North Wales. Using disposable cameras along with his dad’s photographic knowledge gave him the opportunity to start experimenting with the medium from an early age, but being highly involved in outdoor activities and growing up close to the Snowdonia National Park became the main pathway into photography. Jamie’s mind was set on a career in sports teaching after competing at international levels throughout his childhood, but after completing his A Levels in 2012 he decided to change direction and follow a career in photography.In 2014, Jamie decided to study a Foundation Degree in Photography at Coleg Llandrillo Menai, Rhos-On-Sea. After graduating with a First Class Foundation Degree in July 2016, Jamie moved to London to continue his studies to top-up to a Bachelor of Arts Photography Degree at London South Bank University, where he has recently achieved a First Class Honours.Spending the past few years in London has allowed Jamie to develop various bodies of work about his home location, through using industrialisation and landscapes as his subjects, drawing on their history.After several successful group exhibitions both local and in London, this is Jamie’s first Solo exhibition.{{LINK 1}}www.jamiegeorgestevens.com \n\nDifodiad – Jamie George StevensProsiect sy’n dogfennu llinell Great Western Railway (GWR) rhwng Bala a Blaenau Ffestiniog yn Eryri, Gogledd Cymru yw Difodiad.Adeiladwyd y rheilffordd er mwyn manteisio ar y diwydiant llechi yn ardal Blaenau Ffestiniog yn y 1870au ac er mwyn gwasanaethu ardal anghysbell iawn. Agorodd hyn y drysau at fyd newydd a phell ar gyfer y cymunedau gwledig  oherwydd yr unig ffordd i deithio yn yr ardal hon cyn hynny oedd y ffordd un lôn B4391 nes i'r A4212 agor yn y 1960au cynnar. Treuliwyd 10 mlynedd yn adeiladu’r llwybr 25 milltir, roedd 16 stop ar hyd y ffordd yn cynnwys gorsafoedd ac arosfeydd. Ar frig y llinell roedd traphont naw arch arbennig Cwm Prysor, sydd 1278 troedfedd (390 medr) uwchben lefel y môr. Ym 1955, cyflwynwyd cynlluniau gan Gorfforaeth Lerpwl i godi cronfa ddŵr yn y dyffryn uwchben Y Bala i gyflenwi dŵr i boblogaeth cynyddol Lerpwl. Roedd rhai o’r slymiau gwaethaf ym Mhrydain yn y dref yn dilyn y rhyfel, ac roeddent yn ceisio cael mwy o ddŵr ar gyfer glanweithdra gwell.  Nid hwn oedd y tro cyntaf iddynt droi at Gymru am ddŵr, oherwydd wyth deg o flynyddoedd yn gynt, bu iddynt foddi pentref Llanwddyn i greu Cronfa Ddŵr Llyn Efyrnwy sydd 18 milltir yn unig i ffwrdd. Roedd y newyddion o’r bwriad i foddi eu dyffryn lle'r oedd yr Iaith Gymraeg yn ffynnu yn sioc enfawr i drigolion. Drwy ennill awdurdod gan Ddeddf Seneddol ym 1967, llwyddodd Cyngor Tref Lerpwl i osgoi gorfod cael caniatâd gan awdurdodau cynllunio Cymru, ac ym 1965, yn dilyn llawer o ymgyrchu a sawl ymdrech i rwystro'r gwaith adeiladu â sawl difrod, boddwyd dyffryn Tryweryn. Collwyd swyddfa bost, ysgol, capel a mynwent y pentref.Yn ogystal â hynny, boddwyd deuddeg o dai a ffermydd, a chollodd 48 allan o 67 o'r bobl a oedd yn byw yn y dyffryn eu cartrefi. Arweiniodd hyn at bron i filltir o'r llinell rheilffordd hefyd yn cael ei boddi ynghyd â rhannau o'r B4391. Er bod y pwerau a roddir dan y ddeddf yn caniatáu gwyriad i'r llinell, penderfynodd y Comisiwn Cludiant Prydeinig na fyddai lefel y traffig yn cyfiawnhau gwario £1,000,000 ar ail-osod y llinell.Er mwyn dechrau ar y gwaith, daeth y gwasanaeth i deithwyr i ben ym mis Ionawr 1960 â'r gwasanaeth cludo yn dod i ben flwyddyn yn ddiweddarach.Brwydrodd y bobl leol yn galed er mwyn ceisio arbed y llinell oherwydd ystyriwyd hon fel yr unig fodd o deithio i'r gymuned leol. Hyd yn oed hyd heddiw, mae drwgdeimlad am foddi’r dyffryn a difodi’r pentref, a oedd yn un o’r cymunedau uniaith Gymraeg olaf. Dyma un o’r prosiectau adeiladu mwyaf dadleuol yn hanes modern Cymru. Mae’r prosiect hwn yn dogfennu rhan o’r llinell nas ddefnyddir bellach yn ei hardaloedd mwyaf gwledig, drwy dynnu lluniau o olion y trac sydd wedi'u hawlio gan natur ers ei chau, ac amlygu’r amgylchedd a’r dystiolaeth o ddefnydd presennol y tir. Mae’r lluniau yn ymddangos mewn trefn o arosfa Bryncelynog, yn anelu i’r dwyrain drwy sawl arosfa a gorsaf tuag at hen leoliad arosfa Tyddyn Bridge tua naw milltir a hanner ymhellach. \n \n \n\n"

He lost his father to prostate cancer in December 2009.\"When my dad died, it wounded me in the deepest part of my being. The loss shaped the following few years of my life and will continue to do so, but I don’t have to let it define who I am. Through this time, it was really helpful to be able to talk about my Dad. I wanted to share with others about the person he was, the emotions I was feeling as I processed the grief, and talk about the influence he had - and continues to have - on my life. Those conversations were often hard and few and far between, mainly because people just didn't quite know how to respond.\" Loved&Lost is a documentary project that explores our experiences of loss through photography and audio interview.Each participant is asked to find a photograph of themselves with their lost loved one. We then return to the location of the original photograph to replicate the image. CerylIt is a chance to think back and remember, to tell the story of that day and of the person that they have lost. Imagery allows for expression beyond what we can speak of, an experience that contributes to the restorative process in overcoming the painful impact of loss. This project provides a platform, allowing others to acknowledge their loss, to celebrate the person they love and to show that the loss that they’ve experienced does not have control over who they are.“...created to help others who have experienced bereavement, to tell the story of a moment in time, acknowledge their loss and celebrate someone they love....a way of honouring that person.”                                                                                                  - The Guardian  \"It was a good intentional way of reflecting, which is really healthy. It’s important to take time to think about him, but when do you do that?\" - James We all have a different experience of loss that can reveal itself in many ways. Sometimes it’s a response that is quite clear for those around you to see. Perhaps there are lots of emotions that you just don’t know how to let out, you’re not sure how you should be feeling or whether it’s right to be having certain angry or complicated thoughts. \"When someone dies, it can be so shocking and you feel like it ought to be very very noisy, like people banging drums and playing trombones and shouting, and actually, it’s very quiet, because that person's gone, so you don't hear their voice anymore. After the funeral, you are left in a very quiet place, sometimes that can feel wrong because the feelings aren't very quiet.                                                                                          - Nicola \"I hope others can see it as a conversation starter or a forum to talk about things that people don't want to talk about, because actually, if we talked about it, it might be easier to cope with afterwards.\"                                                                                               - Will  Participate Are you interested in taking part in the Loved&Lost Project?The Loved&Lost project is designed to help people engage with their loss, regardless of what it looks like.

Whenever I felt that the camera would not intrude or disrupt the situation I have made snapshots of these moments”.William ‘Bill’ Jay (12 August 1940 – 10 May 2009) Bill Jay's snapshots provide momentary views of the demeanor, and in some instances the working methods, of multiple generations of photographers, including Weegee, Cornell Capa, Aaron Siskind, Barbara Crane, Robert Heinecken, Duane Michals, and Mary Ellen Mark. A new exhibition curated by Paul Sampson and Grant Scott.Oriel Colwyn is pleased to be collaborating with {{LINK 1}}The United Nations of Photography to exhibit, in what is believed to be a UK first, a selection of the portraits Jay has taken of prominent individuals in the medium of photography.The exhibition opens on the evening of Friday 11th May, and is followed by a screening of the new film Do Not Bend: The Photographic Life of Bill Jay downstairs in Theatr Colwyn. We are pleased to announce that after this one off screening we will be joined by the film co-producers, Grant Scott and Tim Pellatt for an onstage debate/Q&A session about Bill's life and the making of the film.More information about this unique screening and how to get tickets can be found {{LINK 2}}HERE.We are excited and pleased to also announce that Grant Scott alongside Craig Aitkinson at Cafe Royal Books are both working together to produce a book featuring Bill’s portraits of UK based photographers to accompany the exhibition and film.The book will be available both here at the exhibition and online at {{LINK 3}}www.caferoyalbooks.com  An influential figure in the study of photographic history during the late 1960s and 1970s Bill Jay died on 10 May 2009. Jay originally worked in Britain before moving to the United States in the mid-1970s. He was a regular writer on photographic history and was responsible for bringing to a wider audience a number of important early photographers including Sir Benjamin Stone, Frances Frith and Paul Martin. Jay joined a consumer photographic magazine and worked for a number of others before becoming the first Editor/Director and joint owner of Creative Camera magazine (1967–1969) and founder and editor of Album magazine (1970–1971). The latter achieved an international reputation as one of the best photographic magazines then available. During this time, he earned a living as a picture editor of a large circulation news/feature magazine and as the European manager of an international picture agency. \nCreative Camera Magazine \n\r\n\r\nAlbum Magazine \r\n \r\n \nJay established the first gallery dedicated to photography in the UK with the Do Not Bend Gallery, London and he was the first Director of Photography at the Institute of Contemporary Arts (ICA) in London. Whilst there he founded and curated the first ever photo-study centre.He gave over 400 lectures to art schools, camera clubs, universities and wrote hundreds of articles for his own and other photographic journals as part of a one-man crusade to, in his own words, 'instill some life into the British photographic community'.In his own view his crusade met with a limited response and in 1972 he left Britain to study photography at the University of New Mexico with Beaumont Newhall and Van Deren Coke.In 1974 he founded the program of photographic studies at Arizona State University, where he taught history and criticism classes for twenty-five years becoming Professor of Art History.Bill Jay published over 400 articles and was the author of more than twenty books on the history and criticsm of photography.His own photographs were widely published and exhibited, including a one-person show at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. His previous monograph, Photographers Photographed, included a selection of the thousands of portraits he has taken of prominent individuals if the medium of photography, a database of which is located at the Center of Creative Photography, which also houses his research archives.  \nMary Ellen Mark by Bill Jay \nTony Ray-Jones, 1968, New York by Bill Jay \nDavid Bailey by Bill Jay \nDaniel Meadows by Bill Jay \nMary Virginia (Swanee)Swanson by Bill Jay \nEmil Otto Hoppe by Bill Jay \nSir Don McCullin by Bill Jay \nCornell Capa by Bill Jay \n \n \n\n"

    "body": "\n\nPete Davis – Great Little Tin Sheds of Wales\n \n\n12th March - 28th April 2018 \nFresh Milk, Ceredigion, 1982 © Pete Davis A new joint exhibition that uniquely combines Pete Davis’ classic black and white prints from his early 1980‘s series ‘Great Little Tin Sheds of Wales’ with Antonia Dewhurst’s ‘{{LINK 1}}Haearn’, a modern day colour study of the corrugated iron woven through the fabric of the rural Welsh landscape.  Great Little Tin Sheds of Wales In 2017 Pete held a major retrospective exhibition at the {{LINK 2}}National Library of Wales, featuring his work from across six decades. Great Little Tin Sheds of Wales was notably the first major body of work Pete produced after moving into the landscape from a city environment. We are grateful to the National Library of Wales for their support. Ty Bach Under a Tree, near Tregaron, Ceredigion, 1982 © Pete Davis A fascination with the variety of these ubiquitous structures made from corrugated steel, and their place in the landscape of Wales provided the initial stimulus for the work. As the work progressed, it became clear that these structures also provided an insight into the social, cultural and industrial history of Wales.Seen by many as 'ugly' intrusions into the landscape, they are in effect only one, recent manifestation of the occupation and use of the landscape by the human population that has been evolving for thousands of years. Tin Shed on Wheels, Ciliau Aeron, Ceredigion, 1983 © Pete Davis The title of the body of work was a parody of those tourist attractions, 'The Great Little Trains of Wales'. These too were another manifestation of the industrialisation of the landscape, but have now been transformed by popular culture into icons of 'quaint' heritage interest. Jones & son, Builders and Undertakers, Blainau Ffestiniog, Gwynedd, 1984 © Pete DavisIt may be interesting to note that many sections of the 'cultural' establishment in Wales, particularly those associated with the language, while applauding 'heritage' attractions such as the 'Great Little Trains', and turning a blind eye to the proliferation of ugly bungalows sprouting everywhere, hated this body of work. It was vilified by many, but achieved great popular success.Great Little Tin Sheds of Wales toured the UK for over two years from 1984 to 1987, many prints were sold to both private collectors and public art collections, and with the income from this Pete was able to build his studio. Today still, many individuals will approach Pete to mention a tin shed they have seen recently, proving that the exhibition sparked an awareness of the landscape that transcended the pictorial. {{LINK 3}}Download Exhibition Poster Dr Pete Davis:The photography of Welsh photographer Dr Pete Davis can be seen in many important national and international art collections. These include The Arts Council of Wales, Museo Genna Maria, Sardinia, and the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.Pete has been taking photographs since the age of eleven. After ten years as an advertising and fashion photographer, Pete moved to rural West Wales from where he has embarked on field trips around the British Isles, Europe and the USA undertaking his projects. For eighteen years Pete was senior lecturer in documentary photography at the University of Wales, Newport and for nine of those years the course leader.Currently he is a visiting lecturer at a number of universities and also engaged with his photography projects and research collaborations. He has received numerous research grants and awards and was the winner of the 2002 Wakelin Purchase Prize for Welsh artists. Work from the 'Wildwood' series has been acquired by the Glynn Vivian Art Gallery, Swansea and the National Library of Wales for their public art collections.He has been a visiting lecturer at the Karel De Grote-Hogeschool, Antwerp, Belgium; the North American Association for the Study of Welsh Culture and History in New York; the Royal Academy of Arts, the Hague, Netherlands; the University of Toronto and at the FotoMuseum, Antwerp. He has also been a guest lecturer at Aberystwyth and Cardiff Universities.Recent international exhibitions have included the Festival Interceltique in Lorient, Brittany, Gallery International, Baltimore, USA, at the Feick Arts Center, Poultney, Vermont, USA and at the Fotomuseum, Antwerp.

Perhaps we envisage a smallholding with chickens and a vegetable patch, or to build and live in an eco-house constructed from reused materials that is energy efficient. It is easy to romanticise a life lived in harmony with nature, but what is the reality really like?Photographers Jonathan Goldberg and Amanda Jackson have spent months independently documenting everyday life in two communities that have evolved around sustainable living: Jackson at Lammas Ecovillage in North Pembrokeshire, Wales, and Goldberg at Grow Heathrow in the village of Sipson in Middlesex, close to Heathrow Airport.United by their respective desires to explore, show, and celebrate low-impact community-based living in the UK, Goldberg and Jackson decided to work together to produce the new exhibition, Off the Beaten Track at Oriel Colwyn gallery. On show are prints from Goldberg’s The Runway Stops Here (Grow Heathrow) and Jackson’s To Build A Home. The exhibition not only offers a glimpse into what life is like in each of these unique communities, but also explores the similarities and differences between them. Both came to be around seven or eight years ago and are home to people that have turned away from mainstream society; yet each community has evolved in its own way.The site where Grow Heathrow is located – an abandoned plant nursery in West London – was first occupied by environmental protesters angry at proposals to build a third runway at the airport. The aim was to create a ‘hub’ for local residents to campaign against the intended demolition of their houses, but the space has evolved into an eco-village in its own right – houses have been built using sustainable materials, solar panels and a wind turbine provide power, and there are insulated greenhouses and cooking facilities.Goldberg came across the site in 2011. Struck by the warm welcome he received and feeling as though he had stumbled upon a utopia, he was moved to take pictures, initially at events, and over time began to regularly document life on the site. His sensitive images depict the everyday comings and goings and personalities of the residents, some of who have stayed weeks, and others, years. But life isn’t always rosy: the threat of eviction is never far away and winters can be cold and bleak.Jackson visited Lammas at Tir y Gafel twice in 2010 and was so taken by the community that she bought a plot nearby and began to divide her time between there and her home in Malvern. She started photographing Lammas, which comprises nine smallholdings, during her first visit, capturing, like Goldberg, the intrinsic qualities of a community of people that has chosen a sustainable way of life based on shared values, away from conventional infrastructures. We see inside cosy abodes made from materials sourced predominately from the land, lush green pastures, and carefree children dressed as fairies. A timelessness and intimacy pervades Jackson’s images, but like Goldberg’s project, To Build A Home asks if the charming ‘dream’ that is sustainable living is really as idyllic as it seems.The projects, and indeed the exhibition as a whole, offer no concrete answers. Their intentions, the photographers say, are to show how people in these places live – what it’s like to ‘rebel’ against the mainstream and to live the life you want. In such turbulent times there is something comforting in knowing that communities such as these, which thrive on trust and collaboration, exist. From the series To Build A Home: © Amanda Jackson The Runway Stops Here (Grow Heathrow) © Jonathan Goldberg From the series To Build A Home: © Amanda Jackson The Runway Stops Here (Grow Heathrow) © Jonathan Goldberg \n \n \n\n"

This area of North Wales had connections to the Penrhyn Slate Quarries and Port Penrhyn where most of the locals had worked until the demand for Welsh slate diminished.   Most of the photographs were shot during 1976 when Garry was a post grad MSc student at UCNW Bangor, he was 21 years old.Photographing street scenes, many of the people he met were happy to pose for portraits some even inviting him in to their homes for a 'Panad' (Cup of tea).  During holidays and weekends Garry worked at Royston Photographic Camera, owned by Ronnie Aggent. Ronnie took him under his wing and they had many discussions on photographic styles during the store’s quieter moments.“I don’t remember getting paid as such, Ronnie just allowed me to take film, paper and chemicals in lieu of wages, which was fine by me” Forty years later these photographs have captured a brief moment in time in a North Wales community, which was undergoing change. How different life looked back then.  These are not photographs of poverty and deprivation but of a proud community of which the elder members had lived through two World Wars. Their resilience and honesty can be seen in their eyes as they look directly into the lens.   \"There will never be a generation like them again.\" (all images © Garry Stuart)  \nDo you have your own photos of North Wales in the 70's?We would love to see them!Be a part of the exhibition...We hope to add your pictures and images to the exhibition entrance - please email any digital files using {{LINK 1}}THIS LINK or pop in and ask reception to scan your prints for inclusion.   \n \n \n\n"

    "body": "\n\nGeoff Wedge – House In The Sun\n \n\n2nd February - 17th March 2017 \n  It is unknown for sure how the Welsh town of Rhyl inherited its name but one theory is that Y Rhyl originates from the Welsh words Tŷ'n Yr Haul which, when translated to English means House In The Sun.  Geoff began photographing the West of Rhyl in 2006 whilst studying Documentary Photography at University of Wales Newport. Initially making portraits of the young people on the streets of the town, Geoff continued documenting Rhyl throughout the recent recession years and subsequent regeneration scheme. He continues to engage with Rhyl's inhabitants, including those who have had to move from their homes due to the compulsory purchase orders placed upon them.  Committed to photographing the area of Rhyl with the utmost sympathy, Geoff has done so for the last decade, expanding his work into what has now evolved in to the archive 'House In The Sun'.  A selection of working images from House in the Sun recently previewed at Aberystwyth's THE EYE international photography festival  in 2016,with the full exhibition now being printed especially for showcasing here at Oriel Colwyn.We are pleased to announce that Geoff is making prints available for purchase, with all proceeds going to support West Rhyl Young Peoples Project.  \n \n \n\n"

This photographic work aims to reflect the histories and stories of military conflict and the memories held in the landscape itself.The series is made up of images documenting some of the physical remnants of the Second World War on the coastlines of the British Isles and northern Europe, focusing on military defence structures that remain and their place in the shifting landscape that surrounds them. Some of these locations are no longer in sight, either subsumed or submerged by the changing sands and waters or by more human intervention. At the same time others have re-emerged from their shrouds. Studland Bay I, Dorset, England. 2011 ©Marc Wilson Over these four years Marc has travelled 23,000 miles to 143 locations to capture these images along the costlines of the UK, The Channel Islands, Northern & Western France, Denmark, Belgium and Norway. Sainte-Marguerite-sur-Mer, Upper Normandy, France. 2012 ©Marc Wilson The idea for this work came out of an older project of his which had contained some locations involving wartime history. His European background and (like many others) own family histories drew him towards a project on this subject matter. Marc has always been interested in the idea of the landscape and the objects we place in it as holding the stories, histories and memories of the past. As the time beyond an event or era grows further these memories, accounts, or documents are sometimes all that we are left with. There is something quite compelling about finding old war defences on the British coastline. Without even looking for them, you stumble on bunkers, radar stations and old radio bases, curious constructions that were never quite put to their fullest possible use and have been left to decay in the face of the sea and the salt and the wind. The Last Stand is as multi-layered as the landscapes which it features; there's historical detail wrapped folded over into a chronotopia of functional brutalism, mixed with local touches that feeds into the geological, panoramic and tactical. All the boxes are ticked in Robert Adams traditional landscape list: there's geography, autobiography, and metaphor. But on top of that, Wilson gives us a politicised view of landscape and power that ties back to survey photography of Timothy O'Sullivan and the work of Mitch Epstein. Layered into that is an Arcadian vision. With its focus on Northern Europe it's a dystopian Arcadia; there is a pagan feel to Wilson's pictures, a syncretic vision where geology, flora, climate and war find a single expression. And it's beautiful. Review of The Last Stand – Colin Pantell  Marc Wilson is currently working a new project 'A Wounded Landscape' More information can be found on Marc's website at {{LINK 2}}marcwilson.co.uk  Oriel Colwyn is proud to facilitate the inaugural pairing of Marc's 'The Last Stand' with {{LINK 3}}Brian David Steven's 'They That Are Left' to form a unique joint exhibition based around the theme of war and remembrance.  Exhibition Opening Times Opening times can sometimes vary, please check dates below if travelling.  \nTues 18th Oct : 10am - 9pmWed 19th Oct : 10am - 1pm / 4pm - 9pmThurs 20th Oct : 10am - 9pmFri 21st Oct : 10am - 9pmSat 22rd Oct : 12.30 - 9pmSun 23rd Oct - CLOSEDMon 24th Oct : 10am - 5pmTues 25th Oct : 10am - 9pmWed 26th Oct : 10am - 1pm / 4pm - 9pmThurs 27th Oct : 10am - 5pmFri 28th Oct : 10am - 9pmSat 29th Oct : 12.30 - 9pmSun 30th Oct - CLOSEDMon 31st Oct : 10am - 9pmTues 1st Nov : 1pm - 5pmWed 2nd Nov : 10am - 1pm / 4pm - 9pmThurs 3rd Nov : 10am - 9pmFri 4th Nov : 10am - 9pmSat 5th Nov : 12.30 - 9pmSun 6th Nov - CLOSEDMon 7th Nov : 10am - 9pmTues 8th Nov : 10am - 2pmWed 9th Nov : 10am - 1pm / 4pm - 9pm \nThurs 10th Nov : 10am - 7pmFri 11th Nov : 10am - 9pmSat 12th Nov : 12.30 - 9pmSun 13th Nov : 12-2pmMon 14th Nov : 10am - 7pmTues 15th Nov : 12pm - 5pmWed 16th Nov : 10am - 1pm / 4pm - 9pmThurs 17th Nov : 10am - 9pmFriday 18th Nov : 10am - 9pmSat 19th Nov : 12.30 - 9pmSun 20 Nov : CLOSEDMon 21st Nov : 10am - 2pm / 4pm - 9pmTues 22nd Nov : 10am - 5pmWed 23rd Nov : 10am - 1pm / 4pm - 9pmThurs 24th Nov : 10am - 9pmFri 25th Nov : 10am - 9pmSat 26th Nov : 12.30 - 9pmSun 27th Nov : CLOSEDMon 28th Nov : 10am - 9pmTues 29th Nov : 10am - 5pmWed 30th Nov : 10am - 12pm / 4pm - 9pmThurs 1st Dec : 10am - 9pmFri 2nd Dec : 10am - 9pmEXTENDED...Reopens 16th Dec - 31st Dec \n \n \n\n"

At the going down of the sun and in the morning We will remember them...\" from Laurence Binyon's 'The Fallen' (first published in The Times, 21st September 1914) \"They that are left...\" : 'Remembrance' portraits.(Exhibition opening days and times can be found at the end of this page)  Brian David Steven's 'They That Are Left' exhibits jointly with Marc Wilson's 'The Last Stand' In 2002 photographer Brian David Stevens headed to the cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday to take pictures of the war veterans who gathered as part of the commemorations which are held across the UK in honour of those who died in wars and conflicts.This exhibition is the result of a ten-year project photographing war veterans each Remembrance Sunday following the Cenotaph ceremony, from 2002 to 2012.Brian said, “The passing of time is an important part of the project, it is only a 10-day shoot, but spread over 10 years, from 2002-2012, it becomes something different.\"Each year they are older, and as they do indeed grow old, as age does weary them and as the years do now condemn them more to what they still remember than to our truly remembering what they fought for (which is very simple : us), they thus become unknown.\"\"These faces then are as of unknown soldiers: no cap badges, no ribbons of spooling medals, no insignia for military rank. Faces, only. Each deep-etched with who they are and what they did, that we might look, and think -- and thank them.\" “Just straight at the camera, please,” is the only instruction photographer Brian David Stevens gave the veterans he photographed.He watched as they took a breath and paused, and then he tried to capture the moment their minds drifted to the past.“The events of the past are on the forefronts of their minds. That affects the portraits. I always like photographing people when they are thinking about something,” Stevens said.Each November from 2002 to 2012, Stevens set out to the Armistice parade on Remembrance Sunday in London with one camera, one lens, one backdrop, and one goal: To honor veterans with a uniform and democratic approach.By reducing equipment and technical clutter, Stevens said he could focus on placing veterans in just the right light, in his project titled: \"They That Are Left.\"“Simple and honest portraits - that’s kind of the point. They don’t need any additional lighting,” Stevens said. “The strength of the face is enough.”This simple set of rules to follow is due to the influence of Danish film director Lars von Trier and the Dogme 95 film-making movement.Stevens was not interested in which conflict a veteran served, or their rank, or actions. He simply wanted to photograph those who served.Of the older veterans he said: “The lifestyle that we all enjoy today is because of them. They are the ones that went out to fight fascism, and that was a very brave and good idea,” Stevens said. “I don’t think that generation was thanked enough. This project is sort of a way for me to thank them, and I wanted it to be quite democratic.”The reason he omitted the names of the veterans, or their ranks or particular conflict, was to create space for viewers to meditate and imagine for themselves.“I didn’t want to put people in order of importance just because they were put in a situation where they had to act bravely,” he said. “Everyone involved acted bravely.”The removal of color from the images is another element that makes the portraits simpler and removes anything that could obstruct or distract the viewer from the uniform approach.“People want to be recognized for this and it’s nice to be able to give people a platform and recognize them for the sacrifices they gave.”After the second year of shooting portraits during the parade, Stevens decided he would work on this project for a total of 10 years. During that time only two people did not want to be photographed.Stevens said he hopes his project will inspire kids to be more curious and understanding of their elders, particularly those that served their country in the military.“When people are stuck behind an older person going slowly, instead of getting angry about it, maybe they’ll think about what they’ve been through.”The strong positive response to the work is \"humbling,\" said Stevens. \"(The veterans) are the stars, I just push a button.”  –Naomi Driessnack, Special to CNN    Brian David Stevens is a photographer based in London UK.

His work is primarily about documenting the people and landscape of Britain.Niall spent the last five years travelling the length and breadth of Britain building up a contemporary portrait of the country. He has photographed more than 1500 people in over 150 towns on his travels from Inverness all the way to Exeter.In this new exhibition, Oriel Colwyn will show more than 60 images from this huge body of work.Niall has also returned to shoot a series of new portraits in the towns along the North Wales coast, which form a unique part of the show.“The project began in early 2011 with a view to simply photographing interesting people I met on the street. After a couple of months, however, I started to focus on building a body of portraits that would be a celebration of British diversity, a social document of modern Britain. I actively sought out people from different backgrounds and different ethnicities, often wearing attire that set them apart\". Battersea Rise, London - April 2014 © Niall McDiarmid \"In each of us there is a curiosity about the places we live, our cultural backgrounds, the clothes we wear, our family ties – ultimately our collective identity.” Lukee and Levii, Bridgend, Wales, 2014 © Niall McDiarmid \"Visually, in film or photography, Britain has often been portrayed in subdued, almost monotone colours.

Studying diversity, subculture, individualism, generations and patriotism, whilst debunking the typical and tiresome Welsh stereotypes.The main aim of Dan’s project was to establish the cultural identity of the Welsh and discover the true essence of Wales that lies beneath the surface.The work was shot over a 10 month period in 2011/12 which also saw Dan take a two week roadtrip around Wales. It was shot on both a Leica M6 and M7 on black and white film stock which was then developed in his home darkroom.The project name came about when Dan was traveling in Morocco in 2008. A young boy asked where they were from, to which his companion replied, ”We are Welsh”, the boy then enquired \"What is Welsh?”The project was funded by the Arts Council of Wales and shown in its original form in The Senedd, National Assembly for Wales, Cynon Valley Museum & Gallery (Aberdare) and the Rhonda Heritage Park.Dan has continued to add to ‘What is Welsh?’ and we are proud to be able to show a rejuvenated form of this exhibition with additional outtakes and new pictures.Visit Dan's website at {{LINK 1}}www.danwoodphoto.com   \n\r\n\r\n{{LINK 2}}Previous\r\n{{LINK 3}}Next\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n© Dan Wood © Dan Wood © Dan Wood © Dan Wood © Dan Wood \r\n \r\n \r\n \n \n \n\n"

The Littleman Coffee Co. in Cardiff City Centre will be the home to a range of Urban themed photography through April to May 2016 whilst also hosting the inaugural Ffoton Talks - a series of events with guest photographers discussing their work and the challenges of working in public spaces, protests and legal issues.We are pleased to be collaborating with Ffoton here in North Wales. A collaboration that will sees Oriel Colwyn host and promote a selection of #urbanwales images from photographers throughout May.Ffoton will also team up with the organisers of the upcoming EYE International Photography Festival taking place in Aberystwyth over the weekend of Friday 30th September to Sunday 2nd October.\"Getting people to take photographs for a reason is the underpinning objective for The Eye Festival collaborating with Ffoton on the Urban Wales street photography competition. Not only are the entrants producing high quality work but also a document of Wales in 2016 and The Eye Festival is pleased to be a part of this project\".\"While giving a photographer a reason to take their camera out for the Urban Wales street photography competition it is also producing a high quality historical record of Wales in 2016. The Eye Festival is pleased to collaborate with Ffoton Wales on this interesting project\".Glenn Edwards - Co founder of The Eye International Photography Festival Over the last twelve months of producing Ffoton,  the founders have been struck by the sheer number of talented photographers from all parts of Wales who are shooting great work in all manner of photographic genres, but who rarely show their images publicly.For our show at Oriel Colwyn we have selected 9 photographers, and each have supplied  9 images from their #urbanwales feeds. Selected photographers: (click to see their Instagram feeds){{LINK 2}}littleappleseed  -  {{LINK 3}}ffoto_cr  -  {{LINK 4}}andrewpearsall  - {{LINK 5}} andrewhydephotography  -  {{LINK 6}}grande_le_onion  -  {{LINK 7}}nspughphoto  -  {{LINK 8}}fudgedaniels  -  {{LINK 9}}slangwerks  -  {{LINK 10}}nickdayofficial  Links. {{LINK 11}}Follow/join in #urbanwales on Instagram{{LINK 12}}Follow/join in #urbanwales on Flickr {{LINK 13}}Explore the Ffoton Wales website, podcasts & Interviews{{LINK 14}}The Eye International Photography Festival{{LINK 15}}The Littleman Coffee Co. / Cardiff  \n \n \n\n"

Picture right was taken April 2015. \r\n \r\n \nBEFORE THEY WERE FALLENLouis QuailInterviews by Katy ReganIn October 2014, British troops finally withdrew from Afghanistan. 453 soldiers lost their lives during the thirteen-year campaign and over that time we, as a nation, became used to the faces of the fallen flashing up on our screens and in our newspapers; images of their coffins being carried from planes and through towns lined with mourners. For the vast majority of us, those faces will now have faded in our consciousness, but for the families and friends of those Fallen, there is no fading and no forgetting. Before They Were Fallen deals with remembrance. Through intimate photographs and powerful testimonies this project honours the sacrifice of the soldiers, but also that of those left behind to deal with their loss. The central concept of the work is the recreation of a family snap. The pair of pictures; the original (Before They Were Fallen) and the recreation, which shows a space where the soldier should be, together challenge the viewer to compare the past to the present and the reality of their absence. This approach to the image alongside sensitive interviews of each participant by journalist and author Katy Regan, offers an alternative to traditional remembrance, remembering soldiers as individuals; somebody’s son, daughter, father, husband, brother or comrade.A few participants were also invited to nominate several, often ordinary, objects that had particular resonance for them in connection to their ‘fallen’ loved ones and using large format photography Quail has revealed the items afresh drawing attention to their now, extraordinary significance as artefacts. \n\nBefore They Were Fallen was first shown at Four Corners Gallery, London, between Monday 14th and Saturday 26th September.

He worked as a staff photographer at the NME from 1975-79, shooting numerous iconic covers including The Clash, The Ramones and The Sex Pistols. In 1980, he helped launch The Face magazine. From 1977-85, he also shot record covers for Thin Lizzy, Elvis Costello, The Specials, The Pretenders, Pete Townshend and David Bowie.He also made a series of formal portraits of many of the best musicians from this time. By the mid-1980s, Chalkie felt the need to change his focus and headed to the United States of America to pursue a new career as a still life photographer.Before leaving the UK, Chalkie put all of his work for both NME and The Face into a vault, deciding to leave them unseen for thirty years, wondering what cultural relevance they may have when he finally decided to reassess his work.Earlier this year, these unseen portraits and a large selection of his best work for the NME made up a stunning Retrospective at the National Museum Cardiff. (9th May–6th September 2015)Many people traveled to see this Retrospective in Cardiff and now Oriel Colwyn, in conjunction with Chalkie, is pleased to bring some of his work to an audience in the north.Chalkie has tried to replicate as closely as possible the original show, including the huge iconic images, and some of the specially prepared multimedia material. The show also includes ten photographs that he was unable to fit into the National Museum, and some photographs taken behind the scenes during the preparation of the original exhibition. Opening days and times.Oriel Colwyn is open most weekdays between 10am and 5pm, there are however sometimes a few changes due to events being held within the gallery.To ensure Chalkie Davies: Creating the NME years is accessible to as many people as possible the gallery will also stay open until 9pm on most evenings.Please check the dates below to confirm exhibition opening times for your visit: \nSEPTEMBERTues 15: 10am - 9pmWed 16: 12:30pm - 9pmThur 17: 10am - 6pmFri 18: 10am - 9pmSat 19: 12pm - 9pmSun 20: CLOSEDMon 21: 10am - 5pmTues 22: 10am - 9pmWed 23: 12:30pm - 9pmThur 24: 10am - 9pmFri 25: 10am - 9pmSat 26: 12:30pm - 9pmSun 27: CLOSEDMon 28: 10am - 9pmTues 29: 6pm - 9pmWed 30: 12:30pm - 9pm \nOCTOBERThur 01: 10am - 9pmFri 02: 10am - 9pmSat 03: 12pm - 9pmSun 04: CLOSEDMon 05: 10am - 9pmTues 06: 1pm - 9pmWed 07: 12:30 - 9pmThur 08: 10am - 9pmFri 09: 10am - 9pmSat 10: 12pm - 9pmSun 11: CLOSEDMon 12: 10am - 9pmTues 13: 10am - 9pmWed 14: 12:30pm - 9pmThur 15: 10am - 5pmFri 16: 10am - 9pm \nOCTOBERSat 17: 12pm - 9pmSun 18: CLOSEDMon 19: 10am - 2pm+Mon 19:  4pm - 9pmTues 20: 10am - 9pmWed 21: 12:30pm - 9pmThur 22: 10am - 9pmFri 23: 10am - 9pmSat 24: 12pm - 9pmSun 25: CLOSEDMon 26: 10am - 9pmTues 27: 10am - 9pmWed 28: 12:30pm - 9pmThur 29: 2:30pm - 9pmFri 30: 10am - 9pmSat 31: 12pm - 9pm  \n\r\n\r\n{{LINK 1}}{{LINK 2}}Buy Chalkie Davies Prints \r\n \r\n \n \n \n\n"

A degree year in St Helens College gave him the opportunity to gain the basic skills in this magical process originating from the dawn of photography.Simon’s camera of choice is now an old folding field camera, his “Patent Reliable” was hand-built around 1890. by F.Bulmer of Dewsbury in West Yorkshire. A small, hand stamped brass plate notes it as being ‘Camera No.12’ and is now one of only three known remaining examples. The Patent Reliable Combining this camera with a Petzval portrait lens, circa 1860, and the Wet Plate Process invented by Frederick Scott Archer in 1851, his vision is to build an exhibition of ‘Tintype’ portraits taken at live sessions at Oriel Colwyn.Tintype portraits were initially made in formal photographic studios, but later they were more commonly made by photographers working in booths or open air at fairs and carnivals. Mimicking the immediateness and atmosphere of these carnival booths these live sessions will allow you to possibly have your portrait taken with the original ‘Patent Reliable’ and see the wet plate process and the results with all their potential defects.The first live photographic sessions take places on the exhibition opening night of Friday 10th July, please do join us between 6.30pm and 9:30pm for an gathering of friends, old and new, in an evening of photographic enlightenment.The portraits taken will instantly form part of Plummer’s ‘exhibition that built itself’ with further live sessions scheduled throughout it’s duration to allow the exhibition to grow and evolve.  Become part of the exhibition:Book your free sitting NOW! Tuesday 13th July - Fully Booked Tuesday 21st July - Fully Booked Tuesday 28st July - Fully Booked Monday 03 August - Fully Booked Friday 14 August - Fully Booked   {{LINK 1}}ON TOUR - Betws-y-Coed - Saturday 22nd AugustTin Faces goes on tour, for one day only to Betws-y-Coed in the heart of Snowdonia National Park.

But in her first year Sue was lured by the darkroom into the world of black and white and the way that contrast replaces colour to define the image.Combining this discipline with portraiture and Sue’s love of people’s interaction became her photographic world.   Laura MorrisLandscape and documentary photographer, Studying B A (HONS) Creative media at Coleg Llandrillo Menai.Laura was born and lived most of my life in the north Wales area. This has had a great influence and is the motivation for much of her creative endeavours.

Her speciality is underwater photography, and portraiture. The portraits are images of wrestlers who had their photos taken some before and after their matches. Her most recent body of work taken underwater is a series of images. It is bringing one of her childhood dreams of becoming a mermaid to life. Nia Lauren JonesNia Lauren Jones is a final year student Foundation Degree Photography student at Llandrillo College. She specialises in portrait and fashion photography using different techniques involving hair and makeup and different props. The work being exhibited is influenced by emotions through using hair and makeup techniques in beauty shots. These emotions are close to her heart because she has experienced each one when going through her journey to get to where she is today. Danielle AndertonDanielle Anderton is a final year student Foundation Degree Photography student at LLandrillo College. She Specialises in Landscape and nature photography working with a range of different techniques from a Quality Street tin pinhole camera, 5x4 film pinhole camera and digital technology. The work, which has been produced, has been taken with a 5x4 film pinhole camera and also a coffee tin. They are of different places around the local Welsh mountain Zoo. After looking at her images as a collective she found that a quote from Winnie-the-Pooh tided them all together -“Some people talk to animals. Not many listen though. That’s the problem.” \n \n \n\n"

He currently lives in Trefriw, Conwy.In 1981, Graham graduated from Exeter College of Art where in 1980 he had been awarded a Photographic Travel Bursary enabling him to travel to the republic of Ireland. This began a series of photographic visits to a small group of islands in the Gaeltacht (Irish speaking) area of South Connemara, documenting the rural lifestyle of this isolated community. These visits took place between 1980 and 1994.In 2013, the Arts Council of Wales awarded a Special Project Grant enabling Graham to re-visit these same locations, to respond photographically and create this retrospective exhibition.The photographs exhibited portray a sample of the many themes Graham explored, such as the sea going traditions of ‘Galway Hookers’ and ‘Curragh’ racing. The Black and White prints (from 35mm film) are from Grahams early archive collection (between 1980 and 1994) and the colour photographs were taken in the same locations between 2013 and 2014.“Today, we live in a farming community that has quad bikes and land rovers to get around in rather than walking every where; we wear fleece jackets and hi-tech light weight waterproof clothing similar to hill walkers and do not stand out in a crowd. In the past this was quite different. The cottage on Anglesey where I was brought up only had mains water connected in 1972. Before then, we used the local well for our drinking water. My initial visits to Connemara brought back early childhood memories of life on Anglesey and how I used to see local farmers dressed in heavy trousers and jackets; a simple, more humble life style that has largely been lost in Wales, yet was still evident in Ireland.”Graham’s visits over the past year contrasted with his early visits as many of the homes Graham had photographed in the 1980’s are now derelict and new homes enjoy the same modern luxuries and convenience as we are accustomed too. However, the images portray not only past, but also some of the present day ‘characters,’ traditional customs and rural life in Connemara that still have echoes to rural life here in Wales.“My documentary work of Connemara has not been shown in Wales for many years, I first exhibited the earliest work 30 years ago at Theatr Gwynedd in Bangor (Today, the University ‘Pontio’ is being built on this site). However, with the support of Arts Council Wales, I have been able to re-visit my archive, editing and creating an exhibition of work that shows many old photographs as well as adding more recent works. I hope the exhibition will convey the character and warm personality of Connemara that I have experienced as well as inform audiences of the strong sense of identity and community that exits within rural communities generally”.     \n \n \n\n"

His artistic work helped promote the position of sculpture in his home country.The Vigeland Park is the world's largest sculpture park created by a single artist, exhibiting more than two hundred bronze and granite sculptures bequeathed by the artist to the city of Oslo.The second part of this exhibition focuses on life in Oslo and the Rogaland region on Norway’s west coast. Jonathan Patrick Smith:Born in North Wales in 1965, Smith studied Photography & Design in Surrey and went on to work as a freelance editorial photographer. Splitting his time between Norway and Wales, his focus is now on fine art and documentary photography, taking his inspiration as much from graphic design and paintings as from other photography.He works simply with natural light, using one or two fixed focal-length lenses, often photographing his immediate surroundings: “my interests are in light and form, the subject matter is sometimes secondary”In “Vigeland” the human figures seem alive, intense with emotion, in contrast to the cold Norwegian winter pictured here. There is a purity and innocence, showing a different side to Gustav Vigeland’s often controversial sculptures of the human form. \n \n \n\n"

Often when an area receives European funding, it is designated as an inhabitable Brownfield Site renovation scheme. Such official terminology can be perceived as disingenuous and becomes a metaphor for deprivation.This ongoing project documents places where the industry has long since left, or never materialised despite the optimism of planners. \n \n \n\n"

I was curious to see how the landscape dramatically changes from a rural, natural environment to a more industrial ‘man altered’ environment as you get closer to more urbanised areas.When you drive down the North Wales coast you can see the transition as you get closer to the more densely populated areas. Growing up in a small town in Wales, I was overwhelmed by the giant manufacturing plants and power stations, I found it frightening yet interesting. It has inspired me to try and project a conscious message in my work which is to illustrate the negative effect consumerism has on the environment and human society.I try to view the world, when photographing, like I am seeing everything with a completely fresh mind, like a more primitive, natural mind, trying to look at the bigger picture, trying to piece everything together visually and mentally, without the haze of pre-determined, manufactured beliefs and ideas of existence. \n \n \n\n"

Expect hints and tips all delivered in a witty, down to earth manner, followed by a Question and Answer Session.Tim has been described recently by Scott Kelby as one of the Ten most influential photographers in the World today. With assertions made like that and a client list consisting of Aston Martin, Land Rover, Lamborghini, Ferrari and a impressive collection of fantastic images to match, this seminar will be one not to miss.His work has been published globally and has been showcased in the infamous 'Victor' Book, a industry Worldwide and highly acclaimed industry leading magazine. Tim's view of himself is a little more straight forward, a man who's known for his down to earth attitude, his feet are firmly on the ground and his desire to produce creative work is one that he has been driven to from a very young age when he first picked up a camera, \"Photography is for me simply a creative passion, the ability to use light and form to capture in a single image what I see in my own imagination…\"\"My work is often regarded as conceptual and dramatic and to me photography is a process, you'll never hear me mutter 'it'll be fine' as that's simply not enough for me. Life is short and I aim to make mine worth while and interesting with work that I hope reflects this. My goal in life is to be myself always, be creative, be true and most of all improve just a little part of peoples lives with images that both entertain and sometimes invoke the feelings that I had when I shot them. I've won awards and I'm always of the thought that maybe they got the wrong Tim Wallace, hey I'm grateful always but never take myself or any achievements too seriously, life's too short and people will forget you quickly. I jumped off a cliff in Norway a few years ago in a BASE jump, why?, well because it felt right for me to do that for myself at that time, I truly believe that anything in life is possible, work hard, be an honest person, tell the people that you love just what they mean to you as often as you can, and most of all be out there shooting because sometimes that's where amazing things can happen.\"Whilst Tim is not being paid for appearing, in the time he has known Sarah at Cambrian Photography, he has been so taken by her passion for helping those in need, through The King's Storehouse Food Bank, that he wanted to help in some way.Tim is also very keen to give back to the photography community and was thrilled to hear about Lightbox, the Young People's Camera Group that we run here at Oriel Colwyn.This has led to Tim requesting that the price of entry be donated to both of these great organisations to help them do more and help more.If you feel that you would like donate a further amount then donations can also be taken on the day of the show. Whilst financial donations are fantastic, the donation of long-lasting food stuffs and new or used photographic equipment would also be greatly received.Seminar tickets cost a £9.99 (donation) and are available exclusively via Eventbrite using the button below.  They are already flying out very quickly, please note that the theatre only has 300 places and you would be well advised to book soon to avoid disappointment. {{LINK 2}}Tim Wallace Seminar Tickets Oriel Colwyn along with both Cambrian Photography and Tim feel very strongly about making this seminar accessible to all.

He was born in Hammersmith London in 1960's and has lived most of his life in Kent. He has now relocated to North West of England where he finds a never ending source of material for his photography. Matt's journey through photography has been over 40 years using mostly film, but has most recently come to prefer the freedom & flexibility of the digital medium striving to retain the integrity of the original image.Due to the fact he has spent the bulk of his life using black and white film, he strives continually to explore the black and white side of digital, using all the modern techniques, to get depth and tone in to his images that he loved to do with film, but with his own unique twist.Matt has a continually updated catalogue of stock photography images which are represented by Getty, Dreamstime, I stock, Shutterstock & Alamy. His stock images are used all over the world in commercial work and advertising.He has carried out work for several press agency's including Ferrari Press Agency and Solent News and Picture Agency.Now he lives in Liverpool he will also be shooting more and more events over the coming months in Liverpool, so you might see him out and about in the city.

The effort of farmers who work the land and continue the practices passed on from generation to generation is particularly important to Laura. It is the symbiosis of survival and preservation, inextricably linked to farming that motivates much of the creative endeavour and the documentary approach to Rural Life.This being the source of her creative thinking and the reason behind the documenting of rural life.The photographer James Ravilious, who documented rural life in North Devon, has inspired Laura, to achieve the work she has done in North Wales.\"One of the great artistic and documentary achievements of photography in the 20th century”. (The Independent). As James Ravilious picture’s show, a special landscape with an elegant beauty of their own.This exhibition will take you on a journey across the natural landscapes of North Wales, over mountains, through beautiful villages and to remote farms and it’s people. Many of these images were taken at local farmers markets and auctions, which clearly are a social event as well as a vital part of farming life. Whilst at these markets it has provided Laura the opportunity to take candid shots, producing natural non-posed portraiture and capturing life as it happens. The images portray a hard but rewarding way of life in a small pocket of North Wales.They were created with the use of two different mediums, digital and black and white 35 mm film. \n \n \n\n"

The landscape will tell you a story if you look at it in the right way.

Comedy is a tough business, it takes years of hard work, pain and dedication to be recognised and if you are lucky enough to get that break it takes just as much to stay there.With all the shots in this show I’ve attempted to capture a glimpse of the tough, thick–skinned, often vulnerable, complex, but insanely talented comedy creature. I’ve tried to show them in a different light to the usual happy, chirpy image we’ve grown accustomed to seeing in the media and on stage.Comedians are very hard to get hold of, they’re busy, they travel, they hide, most of them hate having their picture taken. I’ve had to hassle them, their agents, their neighbours and their pets to find time in their busy schedules to shoot them. It’s been an enjoyable challenge and it was great to catch up with some old friends and also meet some heroes.I’d turn up on my own with camera in backpack, often with little time and even less light. Working with what was available and then asking them to recall those tough crowd moments. I got the feeling most enjoyed the novelty of not being asked to smile and they all found it quite easy to go to a dark, sad, angry, empty place.There are loads of comedians I’d still like to shoot for this. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed it, I’m over the moon with the results and hope we can raise loads of money for AfriKids’ projects.AfriKids is an amazing charity making a huge difference to the lives of children, their families and the communities around them. They are groundbreaking and innovative in the way they approach aid and the future of the beneficiaries. I’m extremely proud to be an Ambassador for such an inspirational charity.\"Dave Brown. \n\r\n\r\n{{LINK 4}} \r\n \r\n \n\"Dave has been an {{LINK 5}}AfriKids Ambassador since 2010, and his work with AfriKids over recent years has been inspirational as well as transformational. Dave travelled to northern Ghana in October 2010 to visit AfriKids’ projects and take part in the ‘Experience Challenge’, where he worked on a farm and gained an insight into life in the rural village of Talensi Nabdam. During his time in Ghana Dave worked incredibly hard to capture some amazing video footage and photography for AfriKids. A selection of Dave’s stunning photographs from Ghana  feature in the exhibition.Founder of creative agency, {{LINK 6}}Ape Inc. Ltd, Dave carried out a comprehensive rebrand of AfriKids in 2010, capturing the passion AfriKids has for their development work, as well as the professional corporate image the organisation needs to portray. Dave’s commitment to understanding AfriKids’ history, culture and philosophy is exceptional and his engagement with the team in both the UK and Ghana throughout the rebrand process was inclusive and sensitive.In April 2012 Dave joined a team of volunteers on their incredible journey driving two vehicles from Southampton to northern Ghana to be used as ambulances. The epic journey took them through seven countries in 21 days, and raised over £30,000!Dave has also helped AfriKids at several fundraising events in character as ‘Bollo’ from ‘The Mighty Boosh’, including helping AfriKids raise £170,000 in 2010 through Deutsche Bank’s ‘One Day campaign’ where employees were asked to donate a day’s salary to support AfriKids, one of their 2010 charities of the year.\"Georgie Fienberg,International Director, Afrikids Dave is making A3 and A2 sized limited edition signed prints available to purchase with all profits going to Afrikids. Prices are amazingly cheap (£50 & £75) so there is no excuse not to treat yourself to some wonderful photographic eye candy!

    "body": "\n\nStreetSeen – North Wales Street Photographers Collective\n \n\n23th September - 11th October 2013 \n\r\n\r\n{{LINK 1}} \r\n \r\n \nStreetSeen is a new collaboration, formed in January 2013 by five street photographers based in North Wales, who share a love of photographing and documenting the urban and suburban environments.Street photography is a unique form of the art, every photographer approaches it with a different perspective, bringing their own perception of the urban and suburban landscapes and their inhabitants to the viewer. It can be stark, or it can be humorous, familiar or eye-opening.Presenting their first exhibition in partnership with Oriel Colwyn, three of the StreetSeen collective show work that represents their individual and distinctive approaches to this challenging form of photography. ANNE MUTHAnne was born in 1989 and comes originally from Germany. She moved to Bangor in early 2013 to pursue a career in research at Bangor University.  Photography has interested her for as long as she can remember, but she truly started to enjoy it during a High School exchange year in Australia, where photography was a school subject and she learned the ins and outs of a darkroom. After that, a week-long summer course about photography in Germany really sparked her passion.Since then her photographic ventures have mostly been limited to trips around the world. On these trips nearly everything that leant itself as a subject was photographed: landscapes, architecture, animals and of course street scenes.Since her move to Bangor she has rekindled her interest in people as a main subject. Street photography is for her, above all, about the decisive moment. That one moment that tells a story about a place and its people. All other things, such as having a fancy camera, do not matter. While street photography is probably one of the most accessible forms of photography (everyone with some sort of camera can engage in it), it is mentally demanding. You have to overcome fears of embarrassment, shyness and being uncomfortable to shoot freely. But in the end a single good shot makes it all worth it. ROY BARRYRoy was born in 1967 and is a native of North Wales, having grown up in Llandudno Junction and Llandudno. He got his first camera at the age of six: A Kodak ‘Instamatic’, as a Christmas present and has rarely been separated from a camera since. Roy has photographed pretty much everything, from Steam Trains, to International sporting events, including Motorsport on 2 and 4 wheels, such as British Superbike Championships, British Rally Championships, World Motorcycling endurance championships and MotoGP.Photographing people ‘on the street’ has really captured Roy’s imagination, he loves to sit back and watch the interaction of people, just going about their daily business. All of life’s dramas unfold and he is there to try and capture the moment, like ‘a story, in a single image.’ Roy also enjoys the ‘purity’ of street photography - a small camera, with wide-angle lens is all that is required, so the freedom from carrying large amounts of equipment really appeals, along with trying to work un-noticed by the very subjects he is trying to capture. GRAHAM KIDDGraham was born in 1953 and comes originally from Liverpool. He moved with his family to Llanfairfechan in 1991 to pursue his career in Information Technology, which occupied his entire working life from leaving school in 1972, until his retirement in 2009.He first took up photography in the late 1970s, when he bought his first “real” camera – a Pentax ME SLR. He immediately saw street photography's rich potential, with its enormous variety of subject matter. It has been his preferred photographic pursuit ever since.He says: “Street photography offers challenges that other subjects lack. You seldom have very much control over what is happening around you, who your subjects are, or the space and conditions that you photograph them in. The opportunities present themselves and disappear again very quickly, often too quickly to take full advantage of; time is a luxury that you rarely have. When reviewing my photographs, I usually think that I could have done something better, but there's little chance of absolute perfection in street photography. All you can hope for is a picture that reflects something of the essence of the situation that you were in at the time.”“Whatever I photograph, though, I try to show empathy with the subject, adding a little gentle humour wherever possible. I'm on their side.” For more information on StreetSeen please visit their {{LINK 2}}website. \n\r\n\r\n{{LINK 3}}Previous\r\n{{LINK 4}}Next\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \n \n \n\n"

His personal view of this coastal area has been formed through his childhood and through these photographs Darryl aims to encourage debate on what he sees as a very much misinterpreted part of the world.Along the Line loosely follows the line of the railway along the coast and aims not only to challenge the dominant represented view of this area but also to offer an alternative perspective through ideas, composition and interpretation.Darryl has been supported by the Arts Council of Wales in developing new work for Along the Line. \n\r\n\r\n{{LINK 2}}Previous\r\n{{LINK 3}}Next\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \n \n \n\n"

Stephen Clarke’s photographs and photomontages picture these changes. Melancholic black and white photographs depict sites now gone such as the ‘Ocean Beach’ funfair and the ‘Coliseum’ theatre, whilst the digital colour photomontages overlap text and images from celebratory postcards of different time periods in the resort’s history.Stephen Clarke’s collection, centred on family snapshots, cine films and postcards, has informed his documenting of the town. This exhibition provides a topography of not just the town but also the family that visited the resort. \n\r\n\r\n\r\nReview by Dr Emma Roberts‘Shifting Sands.  Photography by Stephen Clarke’, Oriel Colwyn, Colwyn Bay.  December 22nd 2012 - 15th March 2013Situated within the oldest theatre in Wales- Theatr Colwyn in Colwyn Bay- is, paradoxically, one of the newest galleries- Oriel Colwyn.  This venue shows photographic work and is exhibiting currently ‘Shifting Sands.  Photography by Stephen Clarke.’Clarke’s subject matter is the nearby seaside resort of Rhyl: the once thriving tourist destination of Victorian holiday-makers.  Over several decades, and with different media, Clarke has documented the town’s shifting fortunes and ephemeral landmarks and this exhibition integrates his various projects so that viewers experience an interpretation of the resort that is complex and long- considered.  Rhyl is usually berated. However Clarke shows the town compassion, respect and directs the viewer seductively to recognise and then embrace the significance that the destination has for its residents and tourists.Using vintage postcards from his family archive, Clarke created the larger and colourful works in the exhibition - photomontages that abound with exuberance, nuance and poignancy.  Beneath these, and acting as quiet counterpoints, are his smaller black and white photographs that observe keenly.  Across one corner of the room a screen relays snatches of conversation that provides additional texture to the experience of viewing the art work, and increase the sense that the viewer is required to penetrate multiple layers of information and meaning for the full significance to become clear.Indeed, only on a superficial viewing does this exhibition have a simple theme.  With more considered examination of the works the richness of their multiple meanings is revealed.  Like the shifting sands of Rhyl, and in the exhibition’s title, gradually meanings materialise and change with repeated viewings.  For example, although each photomontage or photograph exists as a discrete and complex image, study and repeated viewings uncover new themes and humorous signs.  After some moments, it becomes clear that the order of the large photomontages is entirely specific and can lead the viewer on a nostalgic journey if they are receptive.  Within each image is an object that one also finds repeated somewhere within the one that follows.  The process is repeated with each work: one object is presented that will link to the next and another within the image also references the preceding work.  In one instance, the pink elephant of a Rhyl amusement park ride can be spotted in smaller dimensions within the next photomontage.Whilst seeking the clues that thereby form a narrative, one is led to become aware of the unconventional beauty within the scenes depicted.  One photomontage depicts a street lined with 1960s cars of colours so vivid that they seem to contemporary eyes to be airbrushed but- no- these Neopolitan ice-cream hues existed in the days before all cars should ideally be silver.  In the same image, a 1960s concrete building, which would conventionally be perceived as ugly, surprisingly coheres with its environment as the colour of its beige vinyl window panels are repeated in the now funky VW Transporter van nearby.Underneath each photomontage, the black and white photographs perform similar poignant tasks but use different, more restrained methods: for instance, in one, a kitsch funfair bounding tiger placard is juxtaposed with the prim ‘No Dog Walking’ sign.In conclusion, bittersweet emotions result from the wave of nostalgia that is provoked by the collated imagery.  This is the manner by which the viewer is encouraged to observe and appreciate the environment of much-maligned Rhyl.  Stephen Clarke beguiles us with the quirky and forgotten scenes so that we leave the exhibition longing for what we previously denigrated.Dr Emma Roberts. \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \n\r\n\r\n{{LINK 2}}Previous\r\n{{LINK 3}}Next\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \n \n \n\n"

Like the big reveal in the Wizard of Oz, when the curtain was pulled back there was no magic or mystery.The notion that humanity is subservient to the market is so huge and all encompassing it appears to be part of the natural order. It influences every aspect of our lives and mediates our relationships to each other and society as a whole. The tyranny inherent within its philosophy hitherto unseen and therefore largely unchallenged.A public anesthetised by the luxuries that only truly globalised world could bring may have only noticed a flickering of the lights or a faint rumble beneath their Chinese made sofa as a four hundred year old economic narrative collapsed, taking with it many of the myths that had held the system together for so long.But trapped beneath the seismic movement of collapsing ideologies are people trying to negotiate their way through the chaos. Not the movers or the shakers, but those surviving the will of the powerful; The shop workers made to dance for their employers each morning, the skivers and the squaddies, the lucky and the losers.Persons unknown worked on by a system that distorts and warps perception and understanding, knowing little of the big picture except perhaps that they will bear the brunt of it.The Big Society.{{LINK 2}} Si Barber \n\r\n\r\n{{LINK 3}}Previous\r\n{{LINK 4}}Next\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n \r\n \r\n \n \n \n\n"

This map was like a blank canvas, using their own photographs visitors had the chance to turn it into their own unique visual representation of the Bay. The photographs could be of something physical, like the pier or their own house for example, it could even be something linked to a memory or feeling about the area.The map stretches from the edge of Penrhyn Bay to the quarry at Llanddulas and includes Rhos on Sea, Colwyn Bay, Old Colwyn, Colwyn Heights and a little of Mochdre.The exhibition went live on Thursday 26rd April and ran for just over 3 months. It is hoped sections of the map will go on to tour various libraries, community areas and schools throughout the year.The dedicated interactive Street Life blog is archived at {{LINK 2}}http://streetlifeproject.wordpress.com/ \n\r\n\r\n\r\nReview by Stephen Clarke Launched on the 26th April, Oriel Colwyn is a new exhibition space for art and photography that is part of the Theatr Colwyn. For the opening exhibition, titled Street Life, the gallery has opted for a community-based project that is a collaboration between the organisers and the gallery’s first visitors.Collaboration was the focus of one session at Redeye’s National Photography Symposium this year (NPS4). The session questioned “whether collaborations could generate new thinking, save on resources and increase profile”. The speakers included Professor of Photography Anna Fox, the artist and writer Anthony Luvera, and the Director Anne McNeill of Impressions Gallery, Bradford.The issue of ‘new thinking’ was addressed by Anna Fox. Fox described the project Travelling Light that had been initiated by the University of the Creative Arts at Farnham (UCA) and the National Institute of Design, India (NID). Students from each institution had paired up to explore themes of identity and place. People and place is at the heart of Oriel Colwyn’s Street Life. Gallery curator Paul Sampson has produced a street map of the area that fills the gallery walls from floor to ceiling. Visitors are invited to pin up their own snapshots that relate to locations on this map.  As with the UCA/NID project, Street Life will evolve as the collaborative process unfolds, determining how this community defines itself.At NPS4 Anthony Luvera spoke about his involvement with collaborative and community photographic projects: his ‘Assisted Self-Portraits’ project developed with people who were homeless was featured in Source magazine (Summer 2006). Oriel Colwyn’s more prosaic focus on the visitors and residents of a seaside town, like Luvera’s project, belongs to a tradition of giving the subjects of photography the opportunity to represent themselves. Unlike Fox’s students, who will one day be professionals, the photographers of Street Life will not follow the rules of picture making and so perhaps surprise us with the results.Anne McNeill spoke about the Bradford photography festival Ways of Looking (2011) and the benefits that this festival has brought to the profile of the Yorkshire city. Unlike Bradford, Colwyn is not a large urban centre, but like many places it is a town that needs the energy that a new cultural venture can generate. In this time of strained finances it is low budget initiatives such as Oriel Colwyn, and the now established Third Floor Gallery in Cardiff, that can kick-start this interest. With a limited budget and selfless enthusiasm Oriel Colwyn is an example of what can be achieved. Sampson has worked with various sectors of the community to link the exhibition to a series of workshops and activities on oral history, heritage and photography. Local boy Terry Jones of Monty Python fame and patron of Theatr Colwyn, has contributed the first photograph – a seaside picture from his childhood in Colwyn. It is hoped that this enterprising start is built upon and perhaps the synergy between photography and cinema is explored. Alongside independent, classic and foreign language films shown at the cinema this could be a venue for committed independent photography.Alongside the exhibition there is a dedicated website at {{LINK 3}}http://streetlifeproject.wordpress.com/ and a Twitter feed to follow (@orielcolwyn)Stephen Clarke \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \n\r\n\r\n{{LINK 4}}Previous\r\n{{LINK 5}}Next\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\nDrop files to upload\n\n \n\nDrop files to upload\n\n \n\nDrop files to upload\n\n \n\nDrop files to upload\n\n \n\nDrop files to upload\n\n \n\nDrop files to upload\n\n \n\nDrop files to upload\n\n \n\nDrop files to upload\n\n \n\nDrop files to upload\n\n \n\nDrop files to upload\n\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \n \n \n\n"

It is an historic building that has been at the heart of Colwyn Bay since it first opened.For over a year Paul followed the renovations within the theatre. These images are a result of his unrestricted access over this time. Visiting every week he documented areas and objects that have been lost forever, never to be replaced.Through these photographs Paul has captured the various areas, items, objects and feelings associated with the theatre’s long and significant history, preserving its past.These images capture a bygone life within parts of the theatre. Most of these areas are now gone for good.  It is imperative that we embrace the importance of these images and make them available for future generations to enjoy. {{LINK 2}}Paul Sampson - www.focusedimage.co.uk \n\r\n\r\n{{LINK 3}}Previous\r\n{{LINK 4}}Next\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n \n \n \n\n"
